Despite the usual ST predilection for 3-cost characters, this deck is heavy on cost-4+ cards, and building a domain to 4 ASAP will be the best approach in most cases. (There are enough 1-cost cards to keep things rolling in the meanwhile.)

For a deck that expects to draw some real advantage from the discard, this one is a light on support destruction; Snow Graves could be its Achilles' heel, with only a lone Lodge Housekeeper to shovel the icy walk. Still, I'll risk it: party late, eat hearty!
