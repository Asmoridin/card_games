    The plan behind this deck is to create a lot of arcane struggles at stories. You can then use the struggling artist to shut down any struggles you don't wish to deal with. Ultimately you use Stealing the Glory to win stories faster, with enough arcane struggle adding, you can even steal a story from out of nowhere.s
