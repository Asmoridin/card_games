A stall and defend deck using Yithian Scout in combination with Y'ha-nthlei Statue to mill out your opponent's deck.

Y'ha-nthlei Statue bumps off your Yithian Scouts to keep them in the discard pile where they belong while also preventing your opponent from playing characters with 1 skill. Board wipes with Plague Stone and Cthuloid Spawn (use in tandem with Wentawhatshisname) and some targeted removal to keep characters off of stories. Grind the game into a stalemate and mill each turn with your scouts.
