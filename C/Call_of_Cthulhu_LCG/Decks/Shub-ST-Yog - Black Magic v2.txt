    This deck focuses on slowing down the game enough to bring the awesomeness of Silver Twilight 3 drops to bear (mostly Meiger fishing out answers and B. Ramsdale recycling removal) and then answering your opponent's threats as they are deployed so that you can chip away to victory.  The deck has enough investigation that by the time a few of your characters are on the board, the game is pretty much wrapped up, and all the actual threats in the deck are immune to Negotium.  Peaslee is especially nice once a Silver Lance is in play, because trading for a character and then bouncing back Peaslee to your hand once you win a story typically helps end the game quick.  Hayatl's 1:9 and Master of Myths (and to a lesser extent Dirk Sharpe and Black Dog) allows you to easily control your opponent's support, and B. Ramsdale allows you to get the prophecy back quite easily.
