Artists + Madness with Patron of the Arts as the glue that holds it all together.  Hand superiority is your path to victory, as Starving Artist and Benjamin Herriot draw you extra cards while Surrealist turns those extra cards into fewer cards for your opponent.  Once the opponent's hand is drained, Cassilda's Song, Jeff Harson, and The Greatest Fear allow you to manipulate your opponent's subsequent turns.

Hastur is your closer with Tru'Nembra as his wingman.  Opening Night is an obvious combo piece with Hastur and Cassilda's Song.  Infernal Obsession and Fregoli Delusion allow you to stay competitive on the board while you assail his hand.
