    3x Negotium Perambulans in Tenebris (Dunwich Denizens)

    An ideal opening hand includes Priestess of Bubastis, Arthur Todd and Nug for some quick resource ramping. Negotium Perambulans in Tenebris slows down rush decks and enables Savio Corvi's immunity.

Savio and the Claret Knight handily withstand the Plague Stone's destruction, while Dark Young and Servitor are two great subtypes to resurrect from the discard pile with Dark Rebirth. The Mage Known as Magnus provides some targeted removal in counterpoint to the Plague Stone, when there's one problematic character.

(Ia! Ia! Shudde M'ell is kind of a whiff, and I'm looking to replace it.)
