// This is not a subtle deck - by the end of your second turn you should be on six influence, with 
// G'Kar and Ko-Dath in your Inner Circle. By the third turn, get out Quadrant 14 and start using
// the bonus to bring out fleets nice and cheaply.

// You can win in one of two ways. Either go to war against someone use Total War to make sure you
// gain influence, even if they contest it. Almost a quarter of your deck is fleets, so you should 
// be able to gain the edge early in the game. Later on noone will able to resist anyway. Failing
// that, use Never Again to switch your fleets to power.

// Starting a war? Easy - Limited Strike and Border Raid both up your tensions, and there is a very 
// good chance of pulling Mary Ann Cramer too. Play Declaration of War and you can start a new war
// conflict every turn - repeat until you have beaten them into the ground.

// Tu'Pari and the Thenta Makur are in there to let you interfere in other people's conflicts.  Are
// the Centauri annoying you? Give him his PPG and let him do 13 points of Intrigue damage.

// Is someone playing cheese? Use your It Will Be His Undoing to zap a Doom player, and follow up 
// with a Coup de Grace. If they are using Alliance of Races, crush them with military conflicts,
// then Coup de Grace.  Maintain the Peace? Convince your opponent to declare a war conflict against
// you - bribing them with your bonus points for winning, if needed - and watch the hope of Peace
// fade away.
