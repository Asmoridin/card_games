From The Shadows

- Normal damage only converts to severe damage when a character is neutralized. Normal damage has no additional effect on a severely damaged character. Normal damage is removed when a character is unneutralized.

- Unless otherwise specified, "damage" refers to normal damage, not severe damage.
