# So if this deck looks odd or looks like it doesn't work, I'll explain.

# The original printing of Kosaten Shiro can reduce holdings cost to 0 (that was fixed in Gold Edition but it didn't lessen its power much). This makes all the gold in this deck free, allowing you to flow quickly through your Dynasty deck.

# The other card(s) that requires a second look are Akodo Sensei and White Shore Plains. Akodo Sensei passes out Tactician to those over 2 Chi but you cannot use the Tactician ability to gain a Force bonus with it (similar to Aranai Sensei). White Shore Plains was original just a normal Terrain that raised every personality's Force by their Chi if they haven't used their Tactical ability. This was extremely strong for Tactician decks in both Jade (Akodo Sensei) and Gold. Starting with its reprint in Diamond Edition, it added the Tactical trait.

# Still, if you are playing in a Jade event, this deck is pretty cool.
