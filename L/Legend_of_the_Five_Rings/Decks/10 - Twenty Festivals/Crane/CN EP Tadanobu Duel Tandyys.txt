#This is not a rocket deck, this is a daidoji "come and get a piece of me" deck. Your priority, versus military, should be board dominance over fast gain (so basically, ignore your SH ability).
#It is very, very, very, VERY, VERY VERY helpful to start your 2nd turn with a 9 gold production, or better. Grow your economy.
#You wouldn't imagine how this deck can be expensive (there are 10-20 fate cards that actually expect you to spend money)
#The sensei should also not dictate what you do. it's just free, so grab some cards or honor from time to time, is all.
#When facing political deck, there's no way you run faster than him. You have to mitigate his gain/loss, that's when you dig for shirarou, soeka, dishonor cards, and BCIs.
#Versus dishonor, you want to keep an eye on taking a province from time to time, but bascially, your hope is to live long enough so that you can bring him to -20
