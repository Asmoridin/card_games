// Long story short: IG-88 is one of my favorite Star Wars characters so when the opportunity arose to make an IG-88 deck, I jumped at the chance. Sadly the OG IG pod isn't very good so it didn't make the cut, but this is a super fun deck to play with getting all 3 of your IG-88's on the board and just running amok.
