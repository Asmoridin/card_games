// The main element of this is within Sabotage, Legion and Connections - Legion for health/search/free scouts, 
// Connections for recursions, insane shielding (I've had five+ shielded units out at a time by mid-game) and punishment 
// via Discipline and Precision, Sabotage for strong unit damage with Vanguard (and Trooper if you can pop him) and 
// forward command post enabling great blast through Connections. 

// Vader's Fist is fairly middle ground comparative - strong units (despite the singular Trooper really requiring 
// Hoth to trigger), and the Heavy Blaster allowing for additional blast as and when it was needed. 

// Command is there for obvious troopers, Motti and Orbital Bombardment.

// Originally most of the blast damage was via enhancements, then Krennic's pod happened.

// Krennic is looking to be a major helper for the decktype, if not only for allowing six more troopers that also carry 
// a black blast, but also for Assembly Area allowing for bigger units to be cheaper (501st Legion, Snowtrooper Vanguard 
// and the Death Troopers themselves). He's also no slouch and a key force hound alongside Motti.
