// Very strong vs rebels but you need a good starting hand vs jedi to handle Yoda/Luke altho they can be beaten. I have a few things that I noticed while playing the deck:
// 1- I feel a bit of love-hate about lucrative contract. The objective is gold, corrupt official and twist too but the cards in the pod does not have the punch I would sometimes like .
// 2- I have the same feeling for bossk, It can make me win games but those trandoshan hunters are a pain.
// 3- Slimiest scheme is almost needed all the time to survive the Yoda tac swarm, dont be fooling enought to think you can win most of the edge battles !
