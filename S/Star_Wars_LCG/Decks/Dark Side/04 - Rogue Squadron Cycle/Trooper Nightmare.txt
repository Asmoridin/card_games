// Enhancements rule this deck. Try to get family connections in the first objective draw. Each trooper 
// gets shield at refresh. Emperor just for control. Use trooper protect, and imperial royal guard to keep 
// your mains alive. Stack the enhancements to get crazy objective damage. Don't worry so much about force struggle. 
// Don't attack until your board is loaded up and you can clear all three objectives. Take the hit on your troopers 
// health instead of the shield to keep your bonus objective damage alive. If you have to, use trooper or character 
// protect.
// Use the 501st trooper and the E-web heavy repeating blaster to whittle away at the objectives before your full on assault.
