2 Defense Protocol
2 Kuat Reinforcements
1 Reconnaissance Mission
2 Superior Numbers
1 The Endor Gambit

// Deck is straightforward, use your tricks and quick deploying units to inflict lethal damage to your opponent's objectives. Some noteworthy items:
// 1. Escort Carriers form the backbone of the recurring tricks. Use Endor Gambit to keep it open. 
// 2. Any defense should be focused on Endor Gambit or Kuat Reinforcements, as they keep our units moving. 
// 3. TIE Advanced is the unit to pull with Superior Numbers. 
// 4. Your target objective count should be 4; taking fewer will almost certainly spell disaster. 
// 5. Carefully consider how the Carrier interacts with "Backstabber". 

// - New to version 2 -
// --1 Endor Gambit
// +1 BSA

// After playing this some more, I can agree that having the second TIE Advanced is definitely worth the swap. Still waiting for Fel though ...
