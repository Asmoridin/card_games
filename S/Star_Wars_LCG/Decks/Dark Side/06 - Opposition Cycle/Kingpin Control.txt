// Five two-resource objectives enables reliable turn one Jabba or Xizor, and the deck heavily leverages capture effects as well as 
// Jabba 'The Great and Mighty' 's hunter/event discount, (which you also get on your opponent's turn).

// Mulligan for turn-one Jabba, Xizor or Dengar. Use twists to buy time in the early turns by contesting edge-dependant attacks. 
// Stabilize with Dengar's enhancements and objective trigger, once you have a few captured cards. Discard aggressively to find 'Captured' 
// and use on problem characters. Deathmarks/Hutt's Hospitality become edge fodder against Capitals, but it's still a winnable matchup once 
// you get a couple unique characters in play.
