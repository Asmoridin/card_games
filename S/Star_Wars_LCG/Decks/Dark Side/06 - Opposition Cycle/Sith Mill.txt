// This is arguably the meanest deck I've ever built. The core of Sith Control is there with Palp, Vader, and The Inquisitor, 
// but the likelihood of flopping at least one of The Reawakening right away is pretty good. So not only are you holding the Force consistently, 
// you're chucking cards into their trash every turn to limit their ability to make plays. Antinnis hitting the board makes it even more painful, 
// letting you throw cards out of their hand as well. If you don't win by advancing the dial, you'll win by milling out your opponent.
