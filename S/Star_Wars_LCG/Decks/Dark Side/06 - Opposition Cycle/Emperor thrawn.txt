// combo sith/navy explosion lock. goal is to burn thru opponents objective deck quickly.

// lock down enemy units with superior number of tactics icons (or kill them when able with standard sith tricks), 
// then blow up their objectives while they helplessly watch. 

// There's plenty of force icons, so you should almost always win the edge battle - more for denying your opponent 
// their white icons than for gaining them yourself. twist of fate is a danger, but it's a danger to every deck.

// the deck looks expensive, but there's plenty of resources/cost reducers so you should be able to get your big guns out early. 
// and if not just, chump block with your noghri and prophets til you do get the big guns.
