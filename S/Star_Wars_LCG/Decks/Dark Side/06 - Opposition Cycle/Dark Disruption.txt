// This deck is not for the faint of heart. Focus on discarding cards from opponent's hand to trigger a variety of benefits. 
// I think that discarding cards from your opponent's hand and deck is easier, cheaper and far more disruptive than capture. 
// I have played several games with this deck and always take control of one or two enemy enhancements with Maw/Force Pull. 
// Low force pips are a concern, but when you're discarding cards from your opponent's hand, you gain some ground. 
// I typically destroy one objective per game, but I can take two when necessary. Prepare for a long game with this deck, and be careful not to deck yourself. 
// One of the aspects I like about this deck is that the majority of my effects are from reactions on units and objectives. 
// My aim is not enemy units as much as the enemy hand/deck which does not have a lot of protection in this meta. Here is a deck that comes out of left field and is
//  difficult to prepare for. It's not first tier, but it is a lot of fun.
