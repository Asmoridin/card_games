// I play this deck in very control manner. For some time I played with Boba/sth else instead of Xizor  and played it in more aggresive way 
// but Xizor fits my playstyle more.

// R&amp;R was included to enhance resource curve when I wasn't using xizor. While I included him in I wasn't so sure if R*R gonna be 
// good choice but with control style of the deck i find it pretty good choice. All I d wonder about would be second yularen.
