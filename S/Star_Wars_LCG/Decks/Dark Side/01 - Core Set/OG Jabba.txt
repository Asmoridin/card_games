The deck mixes some newer toys into a classic scum shell. Forget those 0 or 1 costing tactics units and instead stick to the classic gamorrean guards! Spice visions on Jabba never gets old either. Is it cost effective? Probably not, but it's Jabba! You can even use him to sneak in a surprise flamethrower for Greedo!

Mix up your gameplay depending on what you have, there's a few decent units for holding the force such as Zuckuss, Boba and Jabba himself. The high amount of blast also threatens objective damage once you shift to a more aggressive playstyle. You can even use Boba to strike three times in a single combat with spice visions! His set along with Zuckuss and Jabba brings the deck to 4 enchancement and 2 payouts. Maybe even Bib hits the table once in a while! His tactic icon is really needed.

The capture mechanics are mostly either to feed the pit, increase your reserve value or in a pinch to increase your force count. Use Captured with the pit as a quasi force lighting!
