1 The Imperial Bureaucracy

Essentially an update on the old style Sith Control, having tried it out this can get really nasty really quick.

Tactics icons come fast and heavy in this one, enabling Vader to trigger, while Palpatine helps to dominate the Force and punish the opponent for committing. Janus' ability to harm and tactics is fantastic.

Bureaucracy is involved for non-enhancement cycle - allowing the pitch of Palpy, Vader and co to edge if needed, or to save after a surprise kill, as was the case in one game for me. Counsel is Counsel, resource support deck.

In the first game with it, had Inquisitor and Palp in first hand, by turn 4 I had Inquisitor, Janus, Vader (Palp had been I Have You Now'd) and three resources out. By the game end with me  having always held the force, it ended with General Dodonna under 8 focus icons (for fun). 

Considering a Ghosts of the Dark Side for the vicious Hunted/Dark Memories cycle - Dark Memories can be lethal in a deck so tactics-heavy.
