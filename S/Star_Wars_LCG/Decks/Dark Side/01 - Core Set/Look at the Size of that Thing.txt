// Turn 2 10-12 resources is common in this deck. Even if the DS never shows, Orbital and a board of 8-14 units is a game 
// ender. The main weakness is an exhaust port right below... wait. No. The main weakness is that this build can get blitzed 
// by capital ships and aggro Jedi. Thrawn, Tarkin, Mithel, and Rule by fear are often not enough to stop the hoarde. But many 
// other times they are. If the Light Side does not play defense, they will not win very often. If they play too much 
// defense, the Death Star will emerge from hyperspace and wreck their face.
