2 The Plan of the Prophetess

The main goal of this deck is clear: take and hold the balance of the Force, and keep the enemy off your back. Tons of tactics icons, unit damage, and kill cards do exactly that, and between Ghosts of the Dark Side, Plan of the Prophetess, and of course the Emperor, it should be a fairly trivial matter to keep your opponent off the Force.

Of course, controlling the board is not everything just on its own. Even if you manage to hold the balance the entire game, six turns is a long time to wait for a victory, and if you can close the game out faster you should. Vader is a nice beatstick on his own, but Executor's there to give you that extra oomph if you need it. You're still not exactly sprinting to victory, but a push is a push, and it's better than nothing. And hey, if you don't foresee needing Executor, the Sith Holocron is a fantastic card regardless.
