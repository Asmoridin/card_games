1 Imperial Blockade
2 Scouring the Empire
2 The Dark Trooper Project
2 Victory or Death

// The point of this deck is to control the Force. The Dark Trooper Project seems to work immensely well with Victory and Death's Star Destroyers 
// as they have 3 Force Pips a piece. Include Mara and Jerec and you have a lot of un-traditional staying power. 
// It obviously lacks tactic icons, with the only 2 being edge enabled and coming from the Political observers. 
// (Thrawn's set screams for inclusion in this deck, and his tactics would also be much welcomed).
// Mara's set could be swapped out for the Emperor's set pretty easily, especially if tactics is what you crave.
// This deck can have some pretty explosive strikes, especially once Gen Mohc hits the table. 
// Suddenly those Victory Class Destroyers can have 3 black objective and 2 black unit combat icons. 
// The Fate cards are also pretty impressive with 4x Echoes of the Force and 3x Heat.
