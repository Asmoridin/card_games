1.  Gain tempo advantage with cards like Rule By Fear, Immeasurable Power,  .

2.  Attrition war should favour this deck due to the strong synergies between cards granted by Family Connections, Repair and Refurbish, Imperial Discipline and Thunderflare.

3.  Stormtrooper Assault Team can keep the board clear and may be recurred using General Tagge if they are dealt with.

4.  Seven resource cards thanks for the 2 Logistics Officers, these guys seriously rock.  Non-limited resources.  It is very rare light side player will go through the effort to remove them.  

5.  Promotion on Krennic or Tarkin = tactics galore

Attack when you can, try to hold force when you can't.
