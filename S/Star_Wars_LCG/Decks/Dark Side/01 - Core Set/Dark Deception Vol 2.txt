// Use the best combo in game IMO Dark Memories/Hunted=Bye Bye to the unit. Janus for spread damage. 
// Mara Jade for Target Strike. Inquisitor for card draw. Imagine Focusing Janus and depending on how many participating units 
// are in play do 1 damage to each opponent units, then during action window use  Force Shockwave for even more spread damage to any
// enemy unit not committed to the force and hence triggering Rav for objective damage.
