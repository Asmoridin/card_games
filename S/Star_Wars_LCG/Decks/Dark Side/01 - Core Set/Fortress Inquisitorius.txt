Use the 7 reserve, characters with edge, and the Inquisitor's hand cycling mechanic to win edge battles. Take advantage of the deck's multitude of discard effects to whittle down your opponents deck options, which will also increase the potency of your Sector Lockdown objective. Use Imperial Fist, Colonel Yularen, and Repair and Refurbish to keep Sector Lockdown undamaged, or, depending on your objective draw, reduce the damage on Encounter at Stygeon Prime, or keep Enforced Loyalty online. With three unique Sith units in the Order of Inquisitors set alone, there is a wealth of options to enable play of your Visage of the Dark Lord. Yes, the deck would be better with a second Encounter at Stygeon Prime instead of the Questioning but this is an attempt to finally put the Questioning to some semblance of use. Tremayne himself is amazing.
