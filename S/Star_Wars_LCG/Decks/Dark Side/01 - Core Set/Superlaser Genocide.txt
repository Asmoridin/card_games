The standard Sith core 6, plus Boc and core Tarkin. Play Dark Genocide for free and nuke it with a Superlaser Blast to clear the opponent's best units off the board. Even if you don't draw the SLB, Dark Genocide is nice just sitting there as a looming threat (and as a way of giving Boc targeted strike).
