// Over half of your objectives have 2 resources and there's plenty of resource enhancements to go around. Just pump out your big hitters as fast as you can.

// The addition of Scum into aggressive Navy is just killer (thanks again, CobraBubbles). Spice Trade is self-explanatory. 
// Hunter's Flight offers a 2 resource objective, an annoying capture mechanic (or 2 mains, each with 2 black blast), a resource and high edge. What's not to love?

// No twist is unfortunate, but with 28 black guns/blast it's forgivable.

// If you want to substitute something in I'd recommend Endor Entrapment for low cost defensive units. You could also go all out and 
// put in Moon Blockade or Sabotage in the Snow. Or maybe there's another Scum pod that could do some work.
