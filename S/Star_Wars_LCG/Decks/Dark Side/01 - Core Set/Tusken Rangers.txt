Yeah, I know. Low resources, low edge, one fate card. You're probably not getting Doole or spice blitz out very often. It really doesn't matter. The synergy of creatures/sithspawn is unavoidable and unassailable. I commonly end the game with a dozen black guns and half a dozen white tactics on the board. 

Let's talk about the two Banthas and the six Tusken Raiders. Every time you strike with a TR you can bounce him to hand to deploy again next turn (when you pull out that Sith Holocron you used to play a Terentatek to play Executor). You're probably only going to blow up one objective, but with 48 black guns and 32 guns, it does not take much to put up a big wall. 

This deck has been super fun to play. I keep learning new combos and nuances of this build. It's nice to play way off meta with good results.
