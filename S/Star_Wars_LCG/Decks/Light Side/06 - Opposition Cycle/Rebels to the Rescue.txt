// My first deck submission.  Planning the Rescue is the core of the deck with the goal of bringing heavy punishment to objectives with captured cards.  Leia brings her martyr complex to make sure Planning the Rescue hits the table and the fantastic Operations Planners deliver damage to captured objectives.  Her fate card and objective along with Kanaan's help to get those Operations Planners out and with Dodonna, there's plenty of decent 2 cost units to also benefit from Spark of Rebellion.  

 

// I've tested it a few times and its done decently well but I'm sure there's room for improvement.  The biggest issue I'm finding is lack of resources to fuel some of the tricks.
