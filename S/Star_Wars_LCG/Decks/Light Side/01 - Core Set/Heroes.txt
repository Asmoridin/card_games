2 A Hero's Journey
2 A Hero's Beginning (Chain of Command 161-1)
2 Heroes and Legends
1 The Flight of the Crow
2 The Master's Domain
1 The Survivors

//
The latest change I made was to replace the Crow with Journey2Dagobah as that set's usability is a lot better (seeing as I cannot edit this deck and it's not worth posting a new one).

 

The deck - with the latest Obi set instead of Crow - went 3-1 in the Dutch Nationals (loss against mono-scum; IE not legal), but that doesn't mean much as our meta consists of "decks that are most fun to play today".

//I would pull 1 owen pod for a second survivor.  That pod is just too good.
