// This is a swarm deck. 10 units have 1, 2 or 3 resources on them. These 3-4 cost units come with a hefty rebate. Building your 
// board with these leaders is important. What will give you the time to build this board? First of all, you have 6 free drop ins 
// (Rebel Commandos &amp; Overworked Engineers) Not paying for part of your board speeds up the process. Second of all, you have 
// heavy blaster emplacements along with concussion rifles and battlefield engineers to refresh them. Pinging away at your opponent's 
// units pays off. Third, building a board means keeping units in play. What about your exhausted Mon Mothma, committed to the force, 
// providing a discount and resources? With Blissex's set protection of exhausted units Mothma sticks around. Fourth, With so many 
// resources you will often not have to use all your officers for resources by a certain point. They can then steal the force after you 
// lock up some of your opponent's defenders with an attack. Slowing the dial down, lets you build that board. 

// Now for the real combo: Use the "Rebel for Hire" tutor if you must, but get that A-A5 speeder tank. deploy a bunch of stuff, 
// using your officers, play "Engineering Brilliance" if you have it and deploy more stuff with your objectives, keeping the 
// rest for edge. Then with your last three resources, deploy the A-A5 and free up your units (Core Leia style) for the final assault. 

// The A-wing and mission are normally fodder, though Ackbar with B-wings and the Tantive 4 has proven a pretty good team against the final battle. 

// The inspiring presence on Mon Mothma makes MtT an elite resource, but when on Blissex, the overworked engineers are only out for one turn. 

// I don't put Alderaan's promise out, but the artist is great for the edge battle and the force struggle. Blissex + Diplomatic 
// presence will give you some control over incoming fire.

// Should A-A5 and Engineering Brilliance never show, 34 rebel resources and the many other bonus interactions you'll discover will ensure this deck has a good run.
