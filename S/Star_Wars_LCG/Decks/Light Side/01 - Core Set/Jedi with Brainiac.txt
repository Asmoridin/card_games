// A fairly conservative Jedi deck experimenting with Brainiac.

Affiliation: Jedi

2 A Hero's Beginning
2 A Hero's Trial
1 Matter Under Mind
2 May the Force Be With You
1 Mysteries of the Rim
2 The Survivors

// So before the Endor cycle dropped, this deck was basically everywhere, except it had -1 Matter Under Mind +1 Journey to Dagobah. 
// My thinking is that between Hero's Beginning, Hero's Trial, and the Astromechs you have more than enough numeral shenanigans at your 
// disposal that not having Red Five is going to be okay. You should still be able to lay down enough pressure on the DS with your 
// character mains that you'll be fine, and the Landspeeder will do in a pinch if you need a vehicle attacker.

// What do you think? Does Brainiac demand Ties of Blood to capitalize properly, or do you think this will work?
