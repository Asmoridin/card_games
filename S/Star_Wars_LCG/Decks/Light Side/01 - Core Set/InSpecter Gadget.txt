Lots of spark targets for swarm. If Zeb is on field, use Sabacc Shift for complete hand destruction. Also combining Lando with stolen helmet to force opponent to discard at the same time you get a plus 1 draw or if you have Braniac in play as well.   Well as you can see this has a lot of combos if played right.
