Rebel Alliance




1 In You Must Go
2 May the Force Be With You
2 Planning the Attack (Galactic Ambitions 225-1)
1 Shield Generator Assault
2 Spark of Rebellion
1 The Secret of Yavin 4
1 The Survivors


Shield Generator Assault solves more Tarkin/Scum problems than Page's commandos. This deck is not "Spark Dependent" so the flop is not all important. Certainly, it is nice to spark 2-4 units, but with ample resources, tactics and fate cards, this deck weathered a great deal at my last tournament.
