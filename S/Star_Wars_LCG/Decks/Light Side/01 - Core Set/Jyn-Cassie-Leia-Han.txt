Affiliation: Mercenary Contacts

2 Hope of Rebellion
2 Mission to Talay
2 Pushing Back the Empire (Allies of Necessity 261-1)
2 Questionable Contacts
2 Spirit of Rebellion
2 Trust Me

// Using Mercinery Contacts S&amp;S affiliation, possible switch to Information Network later if 7 cards is too fast.

// Best starting flop would be Spirit of Rebellion, Pushing Back the Empire and either Hope of Rebellion or Mission to Talay. 

// Obvious combo is obvious with Jyn/Cassie. Jyn/Kyle Could be good as well as Han/Casssie.
