Wanna combo with the lovers


Objective (12)

2 Hope of Rebellion
2 Mission to Talay
2 Pushing Back the Empire (Allies of Necessity 261-1)
2 Questionable Contacts
2 Spirit of Rebellion (Allies of Necessity 262-1)
2 Trust Me

Using Mercinery Contacts S&amp;S affiliation, possible switch to Information Network later if 7 cards is too fast.

Best starting flop would be Spirit of Rebellion, Pushing Back the Empire and either Hope of Rebellion or Mission to Talay. 

Obvious combo is obvious with Jyn/Cassie. Jyn/Kyle Could be good as well as Han/Casssie.
