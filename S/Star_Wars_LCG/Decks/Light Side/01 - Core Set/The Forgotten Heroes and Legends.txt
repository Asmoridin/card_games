I have this deck, but I would really like to bring Daughter of Taanab into it. But what do I need to take out to make room for it.

Isn't this literally Brad Emon's deck from Worlds.

 

I always thought T'ra Saa was a dependable one of but with what the deck is going for she's a powerful main and the event/fate card give some double-strike capabilities if MTF is out.
