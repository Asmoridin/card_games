Just play-tested this, and it surprisingly worked very well.

Deck is centred, clearly, on making use of the Leader trait via Mothma's set. Usually you would use Inspiring Presence on her, though Han, Judder and Crix are also viable. 
The resource ramp-up that is already here, and aided more and more by additional Elites, allows for the board-swarming and aggro capability.
It may lack in blast, but its ability to face most units - especially with a Concussion Rifle-wielding Kyle targeted striking, or an activated Major Derlin doing the same - is nothing to be ashamed of, and the aforementioned swarming capability can allow for objective swarming, 50% of the time reliant on edge, but the ability to one-shot objectives is there.

Spark is included for the handy Objective and Kanan (who technically also fits as an 'Alliance Leader') fitting in nicely as a force-holder and instant refresher - and with Elite he becomes more Resources. He could be switched out, but without including Leia (which dilutes with a capture/rescue mechanic - same with Cracken) I wasn't sure who else to add. Ackbar is possible, but his fighters seem a bit out of place.

Had a lot of fun playing this, winding up with Inspiring Presence in my hand starting each game, with my first one also having Mothma, while the second game also gave me 2 Rebel For Hires in the starting hand to find Concussion Rifle and Kyle when I eventually drew her two turns in.

Happy to take recommendations for Spark replacement, though without doubling up on Planning - 4x Tactician seems wasted.
