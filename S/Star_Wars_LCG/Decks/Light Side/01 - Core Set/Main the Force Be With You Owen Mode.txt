AggroControlTheme
Yoda/Luke with Qu Rahn and Mystics in support. A version of my Main the Force Be With You deck that uses 2 x Owen instead of 2 x Secret.




2 A Hero's Beginning
2 A Hero's Trial
2 May the Force Be With You
1 Mysteries of the Rim
1 The Flight of the Crow
2 The Survivors

The basic idea with this deck is that it's a whole bunch of great cards slapped together. Yoda and Luke are obviously amazing, and Survivors remain staples as ever to resist enemy control tactics.

Flight of the Crow is a wonderful objective to flop with a magnificent main unit, a wonderful enhancement, a strong event, and two utterly worthless chuds in the middle, making this pod a one-of but never ever a two-of.

And of course the Mystics are hilarious. Niman Training is often going to be near-blank, though; the only targets seem to be Qu Rahn and the Mystics themselves. I guess that's useful too, though.

The strategy should be self-explanatory: the Crow, Luke, Qu Rahn, and/or Yoda swing for the objective kills while everything else keeps them up and running and alive.

The logic behind Owen instead of Secret is to make the deck more aggressive, and use the Vaporators as a poor man's Counsel of the Sith in order to churn better and win more edge battles. Unfinished Business is also fantastic, for obvious reasons.

//I'd personally run 2 Survivors instead of 2 Yavin.

Has more offense packed and Force Rejuv is great when your strategy revolves around a few, strong mains.
