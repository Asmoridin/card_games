Jedi work well already but I wanted to try something different. Asteroid base has proven a really good card if you can exploit it so the idea is to have lots of small units with shields, some good characters that can be recurred thanks to MTFBWY, H&amp;L and Last Minute Rescue. I usually play with 11 or 12 objectives when playing Jedi because I want to dump my hand in every Edge battle and still be able to draw characters to attack with and because it gives more flexibility
