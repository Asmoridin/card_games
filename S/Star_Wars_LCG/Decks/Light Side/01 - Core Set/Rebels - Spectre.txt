Experimental
My first tri-faction deck created to test the synergy of the new Spectre trait cards and influence objectives.
The Gardner's Secrets is included for the enhancement synergy.
Along the Gamor Run might work out well in the deck with units like Children of the Force and Gamor is always a solid objective set.
I'm sure when Hera's set is revealed I will replace Forward Reconnaissance or whatever rebel placeholder I am toying with at the time.

Replaced May The Force Be With You with Matter Under Mind to test the loads of small easy to get units. Attempting to fish for Signal Scanner with Momaw also.
