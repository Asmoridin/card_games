This deck is focused on taking out the Death Star. Chock full with vehicles and pilots, it is ready to win against overwhelming odds.

Of course, pulling Trench Run and putting all of your power into taking out the Death Star dial itself would be fun, though this deck doesn't strictly rely on that. Grabbing Wookie Navigator to make multiple hits against the Death Star would be great, along with Blue Leader and Home One to be able to still get hits in on the other objectives while trying to focus on the Death Star itself.
