Nothing special : get the fighters/speeders out, call for the pilots, rush the target, blast the bad guys.

Still Pending :
- Is Red 5 worth it?
- What about Red 2? Which POD to discard if it's to be included?

Sugg: I would probably drop a journey to dagobah out of the deck, and replace it with defense of Yavin 4. I think it synergizes much better and you get a couple more fighters, a replacement resource, a much better objective and a rebel assault, and rebel assault wins games.
