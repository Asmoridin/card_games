// I hope you fell for the clickbait title.

// One of the deck archetypes I've had the most trouble with in the past is Falcon/Jedi. The concept is simple enough since you're 
// combining two of the best pods LS has to offer, but I've always ran into issues.

// The first big issue I've run into is that the Falcon is a very expensive pod and running it as a x2 really increases the 
// cost curve of your deck which requires that you have a good amount of money to spend. Any deck that I have with double Falcon 
// mandates that I have more than 6 resource enhancements so I can find one T1 and keep pumping them out in the early game. 

// It also doesn't help that I'm very hypercritical of the resource curve for LS. I'm not a fan of the Guest Quarters at all. 
// In an increasingly oppressive DS meta, I absolutely need to build a board fast and a T1 Guest Quarters will not allow me to 
// play the precious Falcon T2. The same goes with tempo killing 2/1's although those are arguably even worse because I won't be able to play a 4-cost main T1.

// The other big problem I've ran into was poor objective flops. Previous iterations of the Falcon/Jedi generally consisted of 
// x2 Falcon/MTF, x1 Gamor and a hodgepodge selection of Jedi objectives. Unfortunately, I tended to get into situations 
// where the only Jedi objective I wanted to see was MTF but I needed two Jedi objectives on the flop to prevent resource locking. 
// Is this a product of bad deckbuilding? Probably, but one thing you'll notice even in this deck is that the Smuggler objectives have much higher priority than Jedi.

// The new Jedi-into-Smuggler affiliation card solves both of these problems. In terms of objective flops, I'm now in a 
// position where I only want to see one Jedi objective (which is MTF obviously, but in the occasion I don't flop it A New Beginning isn't bad) 
// and two Smuggler objectives. Running Jedi affiliation also allows for the inclusion of a pod like Watchers which I would have never ran in a 
// previous version of this archetype since it's a dud objective. This affiliation also allows access to some other interesting pods (more on that later).

// The biggest remedy though is having access to 5 resources T1. I've built this deck to basically have a variety of great starts that are 
// adaptable to a ton of different situations. In terms of resource enhancements, I can play a 4-drop and a Guest Quarters and still have 5 
// resources the following turn to drop the Falcon. It isn't ideal, but I can drop Jyn's resource and a 4-drop T1 for some delayed gratification. 
// If I'm facing down DLOTS, I could drop a 3+2 drop or a 4+1 drop so my main doesn't get locked out. If I'm in a situation where I mulligan
// into only a Falcon or Obi as playable unit I'm completely screwed either.

// Other than that, the deck is relatively standard in terms of what you would expect from something competitive; tons of aggressive mains, 
// good amount of resources, high edge and two Twists. Just get your mains out and go to town. Also, Jyn's pod is so nasty. It's everything 
// I wanted Zeb to be in previous iterations of the deck. You may not be using her text to double-strike, but I'm never going to complain about 
// free card draw and her icon spread is still killer. 

// The big downside I can see with this deck are non-ideal objective flops. I've yet to test extensively with a 5/5 split but I'm hoping
// that probability will consistently deliver and I'll draw into 2 Jedi and 2 Smuggler objectives. In the occasion I draw into 3 Jedi and 
// 1 Smuggler I hope that MTF will be the DS player's first target and I can draw one of my 3 resource enhancements that can provide a Smuggler match. 
// I imagine you won't be playing 2 cards of the same affiliation until mid-to-late game when you have your resources out. This same problem can also 
// occur with Jedi if you end up overlocking your affiliation card. 

// So if I did have to change anything in the deck it would be to take out both Ahsokas. Her pod really doesn't seem to get much 
// love around here but I included her for a variety of reasons; she's a powerful main with card draw that I can commit to the force, her 
// pod overall has high edge (which is compounded with all of the other edge bonuses this deck offers) and honestly it just seems like a cool idea. 
// I'm also a big fan of her chud; you won't be killing anything with it but it can soak up DLOTS and it can help you win clutch edge battles.
// I don't consider it to be a 1-unit pod at all and even if I did, all of the other units in the deck aren't duds.

// There's a bunch of options for replacing Ahsoka, the most conservative of which would probably be to run x1 of Core and Endor Luke. 
// They obviously feed off each other and I appreciate the extra resource that Core Luke provides. But, I don't ever want to commit either of them to the force. 

// The Crow is also an interesting option. Although you can't bounce him into play with the Falcon, he still has 4 bombs and
// provides both a super-resource and a board wipe while the other 3-unit pods can pick up the slack that comes from running 
// what is essentially a 1-unit pod. A more streamlined option would also be Journey to Dagobah.

// A couple of other interesting options include Kyle or T'ra Saa for more mains with high edge. One thing the deck does lack though is 
// some form of shielding/protect which makes a case for SOY4 or Ties of Blood. Experiment at your own pace.

// That's all I got. If you made it this far you're a real champ. I speculated a long time ago that this new affiliation card would exist and I've
// been mulling over this for ages. This is as close as I'm getting to "fixing" the issues I've had with Falcon/Jedi. Enjoy!
