// Point is to destroy an opponent as soon as possible. With the time it gets harder.
// So basically we try to put some ships first turn(best sleuths) and push him. Use some tricks, like swindled to make the defense impossible and hit with support damage from your objectives. Its happens to destroy first objetive during your first turn(even with just undercover operative, lol). In worst key scenario just divide your forces to put as much damage as you can or to force your opponent to divide his defence and let you go for at least one objective with edge and unopposed bonus.
