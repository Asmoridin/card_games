// Chip away at your opponents hand by combos such as The Last Warrior/Embers of hope + Sabacc Shift. Spirit of Rebellion + Spark 
// would also make opponent discard. You see what I'm trying to do here.. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I love dicard decks and 
// want to build a competitive version
