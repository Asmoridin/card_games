// Find and use Luke on Stolen AT-ST or Outrider to try one-shot an enemy objective even despite of a wall of defenders. (Stolen AT-ST often is unfocusable 
// and undamageable and Outrider can suddenly join an engagement when defenders are exhausted).

// 2 Han Solo (to find Luke), 6 Stay on Targets and some shields around (Loyal Co-Pilot, Luke's enhancement, Toryn Farr, Hiding Among Enemies) to help you 
// perform the "trench" strike. 

// Also several pilots on Red Squadron X-Wing (potentially 4 - with Nien Numb and Loyal Co-Pilots on the board) - that's funny. Discarding Luke 
// from this ship can really allow you to use his ability several times per turn (i did it, but tbh unfortunately only to get one additional damage for two strikes).

// There is no Twist of Fate, but a lot of black icons. Moreover, 10 three-pip cards, Tydirium, YT-2000 Freighter, Rogue Squadron Assault's card draw 
// effect and Hiding Among Enemies make it possible to win the edge sometimes (and use "every time surprised" I Have You Now) as well.

// For good setup turns there are 8 non-limit resource enhancements along with two-resource affiliation card,  3 two-resource objectives and 
// many (actually most of the units) 2-3 cost guys and ships (5 with three pips to take the Force back on turn two and keep the Force later).

// The truth though - most times Luke does 0-2 damages, so the deck is great only in order to "flop Palpatine to blow up an objective with pilot Luke", 
// just for fun. It doesn't contain any board removals (events, targeted strike), so the opponent builds the board and you loose.
