// This is a slight modification of the deck I've been playing for the past half year or so competitively and it follows one 
// simple philosophy; win edge and lock out your opponent's board. Every pod has a tactic and it's pretty easy to build a wall 
// that can just shut out everything. You know what's really nasty? Cassian freeing up Obi or a Speeder Bike to put out 5 
// tactics in one engagement; it happens a lot more often than you would expect and it's often a move that will guarantee you the game. 

// What I really enjoy about this deck is that there are a lot of defined synergies that help it gel. Winning edge is pretty easy 
// in this deck thanks to a lot of card draw engines. I have four Yavin 4 objectives which means I'll find one on the flop and this 
// allows Dodonna to be a very reliable card draw engine. Planning the Attack is an extreme thorn in a DS player's side and in most games 
// the only way they'll be able to turn it off is if they over-commit to an attack which allows for swift retribution on your following turn. 
// Obi's Robes also compounds this insane reserve increase. Add onto this a high pip count, a few edge-1 units, Teamwork and two Twists and you'll 
// rarely lose the edge battles that you need to win. 

// Most people may complain about the Tacticians but they do serve a pretty strong purpose here. Not only do they provide tactics but 
// they're also a cheap trigger for Pushing and they can give Obi edge-1. Half of the deck has Leaders to give them a few extra icons 
// and the Saboteurs can provide shielding to prevent them from dying to a ping. 

// A few other assorted comments:

// -Having double Obi and Hera means I'll find a 2-resource objective on the flop which is really important when I'm trying to play the War Room T1.
// -A big issue I've always had with BTS Luke is that I want four 1-cost enhancements to allow for a lot of double-striking. It's not ideal, but 
// I can use Obi's Robes for that. 
// -Four Allies is nasty but all of the fate cards here are great.
// -Four Saboteurs are also really nasty. In my opinion, they're the best source of shielding LS has and having that much event cancel is nice. 
// They become huge threats when Hera gives them another gun. 

// If you're looking for a brutal but easy to pilot LS deck, look no further!
