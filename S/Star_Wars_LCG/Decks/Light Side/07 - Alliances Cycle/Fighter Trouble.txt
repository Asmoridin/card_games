// I can NEVER get fighter decks to work.  Ever.  I always feel you need to have the right combination of cards on the table 
// (matching pilots and enhancements) and it I just can't seem to make it come together.  However, I am still determined to experiment.

// First the obvious: 12 objectives.
// The pip count right now is 96, which is good.  However, if I take out some obvious pods the pip count goes way down.
// Take out 1 Haunting: the count goes down to 88 (and I lose a resource)
// Take out Alderaan's Promise: the count goes down 86, which is bad.
// Take out 1 Leia: the count doesn't suffer too much, but I lose half of her mechanic, and a Twist.
// Maybe take out a Biggs?

// Why Leia?
// I like the idea of flooding the board and potentially freeing up all the units to strike again.  This is the reason Han is in here.  
// He can be sacrificed to grab Leia.  Plus, the objective adds 9 pips and has a zero cost resource.

// Why on Earth is Alderaan's Promise even in here?
// Something different.  Plus, it has 10 pips, gives me a better chance to hold the Force, a resource, the ability to search for a 
// unique unit, and to redirect engagements and damage to an objective.
