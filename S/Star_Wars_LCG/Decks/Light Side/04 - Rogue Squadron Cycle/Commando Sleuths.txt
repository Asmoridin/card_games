Affiliation: Rebel Alliance

2 Across the Anoat Sector
2 Against All Odds
2 Commando Operations
1 Commando Raid
1 Hit and Run
2 Raise the Stakes

// Thinking about what to build around the commando/fate card core (corps?). 

// ESsentially lone attacker tech supplemented by the occasinoal surprise commando. 
// Possible anti-synergy on attack, and possibly better flashed in on defense. 

// Sugg: I'm using the same deck except swapping 2 Commando Operations for 2 Defense of Yavin 4.  
// Cheaper units and Rebel Assault make it a bit faster I think.  How has your version worked out so far?
