// Get your Wookiees and Jedi out quickly. Start enhancing your Wookiees as soon as you can. (having Heart of a Wookiee and Old Ben's Spirit on Chewbacca is intense, having Old Ben's Spirit on Rahn is great.)

// Keep Rahn in the back lines, commited to the Forse but never on the offense.

// There's just no way to avoid Deadly Gaze (unless you have both Faithful Companions in play and The Plan of The Prophetess isn't out), but if it happens then use the opportunity to play Loyal Wookie for free.

// Trust Your Feelings and Calm keep you attacking (or defending)
