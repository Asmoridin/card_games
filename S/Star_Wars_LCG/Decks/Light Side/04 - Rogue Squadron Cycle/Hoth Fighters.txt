2 Attack Pattern Delta
2 Called to Arms
1 Echo Base Defense
2 Hoth Operations
2 Rogue Squadron Assault
2 The Hoth Gambit

// Thinking of putting in a Hold the Line, or take out Echo base defense...

// The hope is to get 2 Hoth Gambit and 1 Called to arms as part of your first Objective pull, making you have 2 Force Icons commited to your side of the force, 
// Thus FORCING the opponent to commit one of his bigger units to take it. Keep the hoth Objectives up and dish out pain using Speeders and Fighters. 
// Most DS decks seem to not use Hoth Objectives so the "if you control more" ideas can be really helpful here.
