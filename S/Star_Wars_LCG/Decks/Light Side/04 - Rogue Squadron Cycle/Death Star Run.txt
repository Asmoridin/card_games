// This deck is focused on taking out the Death Star. Chock full with vehicles and pilots, it is ready to win against overwhelming odds.

// Of course, pulling Trench Run and putting all of your power into taking out the Death Star dial itself would be fun, 
// though this deck doesn't strictly rely on that. Grabbing Wookie Navigator to make multiple hits against the Death Star would be 
// great, along with Blue Leader and Home One to be able to still get hits in on the other objectives while trying to focus on the Death Star itself.
