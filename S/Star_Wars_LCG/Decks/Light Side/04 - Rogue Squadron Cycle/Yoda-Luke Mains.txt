// An aggressive Luke/Yoda control deck taking advantage of Between the Shadows

// A few updates now that the new pack is out. The fact is, Owen is basically a Jedi's version of Sith Holocron, and Moisture Vaporator is practically a Jedi version of 
// Counsel of the Sith, so that pod is far too good NOT to use in mono-Jedi, not even counting how good Unfinished Business is. Removing Red Five and Core Luke from the 
// deck does slightly nerf it, but I'm hoping the Landspeeder can make up for that, and the additional tactics icons are a BIG help.

// Fun trick: Shien Training on Qu Rahn. Qu Rahn catches quite a bit of hate, because if the DS player attacks any other Characters Qu Rahn will just soak it 
// up and then throw it at their objective. Deflect the damage from Qu Rahn to another Character, then take it back via Protect and damage the objective.
