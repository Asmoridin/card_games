// Unleash the cracken, tactics, Endor shenanigans and powerful edges

// Cracken rescue shenanigans boosted by Feigning captivity. Most mains have tactics allowing to better control defenders, 
// a bit of fate cards manipulation to make edge battles a dangerous place for your opponent.

// Killer setup is done with Feigning Captivity on the board with Cracken out, allowing you to 
// stack objectives with captured cards and extra impact damage. 

// This deck has done surprisingly well versus current navy because of the sources of extra damage allowing objectives 
// to be taken out fast and missions negating some navy healing tricks.

// I had a long debate about replacing one Secret Weapons with one Turning the tide but I feared a fifth mission
// might clog the deck and even with 4 I find myself dumping missions in edges. Having Tydirium on the board however really 
// messes with dark side and the Stolen AT-ST is just awesome
