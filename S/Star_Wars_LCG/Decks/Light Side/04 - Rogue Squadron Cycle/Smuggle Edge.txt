// Personal Hope was to get Last Defense of Hoth, A Hero's Resolve and 1 other objective at the start, hoping to play 
// System Patrol Craft to keep Last Defense active. Not much to it other then that, thinking of dropping Hero's Resolve just dont 
// know what for, its largely just there for its good edge winning capabilities.
