// This deck is a pretty fun to play blow'em up deck.

// You have 3 leaders, Han, Ackbar, and Dodonna, all of them have a tactics and blast so they are great targets for double strike.

// You have planning the attack and defense of Yavin 4 to make things cheap, but its not really all that great since it'll only reduce Red Five, Red 2 and your Y-wings.

// The power in this deck comes from having a ton of 1 cost units and spreading your attack out to include missions. Turning 
// the tide can make Rebel Assault incredibly efficient. Would probably be better with Solidarity of the spirit in for red 5 but I 
// really wanted the double strike leaders to shine. With Han and his troopers I've gotten him to swing 3-4 times in a combat before :).
