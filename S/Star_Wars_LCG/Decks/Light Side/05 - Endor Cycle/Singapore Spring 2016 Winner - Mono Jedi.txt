// Standard Mono-Jedi deck.
// Try to get bodies out as fast as possible. Put the pressure on by attacking and exhausting opponent.

// Some tips:
// If Yoda, You Seek Yoda is drawn in starting hand, play it during opponent's draw step to avoid Rule by Fear.

// Always attack with speeder bikes to exhaust first.

// If Brainiac is present with no dark side targets, some juicy light side targets include: Luke, to increase the damage dealt with attachments, Force Cleansing to refresh a unit committed to the Force during opponent's turn, or even to simply boost the Speeder Bike's and Wolfman's Edge to 2.
