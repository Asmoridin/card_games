2 The Survivors

// Yoda/Luke with Qu Rahn and Mystics in support. A version of my Main the Force Be With You deck that uses 2 x Owen instead of 2 x Secret.

// The basic idea with this deck is that it's a whole bunch of great cards slapped together. Yoda and Luke are obviously amazing, and Survivors 
// remain staples as ever to resist enemy control tactics.

// Flight of the Crow is a wonderful objective to flop with a magnificent main unit, a wonderful enhancement, a strong event, and two utterly 
// worthless chuds in the middle, making this pod a one-of but never ever a two-of.

// And of course the Mystics are hilarious. Niman Training is often going to be near-blank, though; the only targets seem to be Qu Rahn and 
// the Mystics themselves. I guess that's useful too, though.

// The strategy should be self-explanatory: the Crow, Luke, Qu Rahn, and/or Yoda swing for the objective kills while everything else keeps them up and running and alive.

// The logic behind Owen instead of Secret is to make the deck more aggressive, and use the Vaporators as a poor man's Counsel of the 
// Sith in order to churn better and win more edge battles. Unfinished Business is also fantastic, for obvious reasons.

// I'd personally run 2 Survivors instead of 2 Yavin.

// Has more offense packed and Force Rejuv is great when your strategy revolves around a few, strong mains.
