I had completely forgotten how dense WoT cards can be. So, you recruit Sentries and give it Andor allegiance, then Leader of Nations Andor.

Later, you get Illian allegiance symbols from Andor or Saboteurs or whatever.

Why is Dragonmount in this deck when I don’t think it’s a legal play? Most Light side starting characters are Rand, and Dragonmount became a staple play. I’ll make this mistake again.

The Wheel Weaves may not actually be in this deck. I have two proxies in this deck (well, at least two). I routinely proxied Lucky Find with Lightning. I proxied something with The Truth They Tell. Maybe Moment of Transition (best card drawing).

Is this deck competitive? I don’t think I knew. I probably only played this like once or twice. I was not focused on nation allegiances like another playtester in our group.

Seems like this deck should have more copies of Andor. I think you can have 3x the nation contested advantages.

Why is this deck 61 cards? Maybe Dragonmount got replaced, but I didn’t actually remove it. Certainly doesn’t have good card draw. Actually, maybe Dragonmount is a proxy for a card drawing advantage, like … no, probably not.
