So much shuffling. Yet another suboptimal feature of the game. Let’s start by shuffling Mandarb to get Lan, then keep shuffling Squadrons to search out other ones.

A feature of Precedence CCGs was choosing your starting hand, a feature I’m all in favor of. But, it got crazy with expansions where cards search other cards in chains.

One of my discoveries early on was that the way to counter recruiting snowballing is to shorten the game. The challenges here are meant to compensate for how badly this deck actually recruits compared to the norm.

Note how you keep seeing the same cards over and over. Lucky Find is like automatic 2-3 copies. Moment of Transition is broken. Invasion is broken. Connections when can generate politics reasonably.

This was totally my kind of deck – aggro. Yup. I did aggro in games more than 20 years ago.
