Another training deck I am intending to try and tempt people into the game with.

Built from a pool of 3x core, all the deluxe boxes and Shifting Sands, I wanted a deck which would give a fair spread of the icons, whilst also showing some of the tricks available.

I wanted something which would show an alternative to my other teaching deck, though unintentionally also has Carl Stanford!

As the other deck has Yog-Sothoth who can be reduced, I wondered what other ways I could reduce another Ancient One, and settled on Cthulhu thanks to Seeker of Mysteries and Lord of the Silver Twilight. The Night also turns up, solely because I got a promo copy of it, and between using Night effects and Seeker of Mysteries, it should be affordable too.

I didn't want to go near Loyal, Fated or Transient, but felt Day and Night come up enough to help make things interesting, whilst showing the difference it can make to characters such as Guardian of Dawn.

Any thoughts or suggestions will always be appreciated :)
