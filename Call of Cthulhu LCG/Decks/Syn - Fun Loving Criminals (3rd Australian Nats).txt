Fast deploy &amp; lots of criminals.
The new cards means you are drawing quick.
Low cost criminals which are cheaper with Johnny V's Dame.
Gunner Runners Club for draw.
Wheelman with Mr Pan/ Hatchman to mess up opponent's challenges.
St Claire &amp; Lena can lock out a lot of characters.

Sugg: Why is Cascio in there? With no conspiracies, Immurement and On the Lam in the deck I'd have said Naomi O'Bannion was a much better pick.
