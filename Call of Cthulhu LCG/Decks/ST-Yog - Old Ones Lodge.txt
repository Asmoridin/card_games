Lessons learned:

1) Do not make last minute (night before) changes for your thought of the meta. 

2) Added Daybreak! as day card. Could have used Hermetic Seal, just thought that Savio and terror would be plenty active, as this is was a Conspiracy story deck match.   I was wrong. 

3) check your ancient one count and your tricks to get it out. Drove many characters insane, to have no ancient one to play. 

4) Added Housekeeper for anti-support. I saw 3 support cards in 3 matches.   And one of the conspiracies prevented the festival from doing much. 

5) A first play Dampened Light, appears to be strong enough to justify a mulligan.

6) The deck is strong enough to make a top 8 World's deck Plague Stone on the third turn, with Savio on his board. Still lost 3-2 with a Dark Rebirth doing me in.
