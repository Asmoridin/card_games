Classic character removal and recursion

This is the deck used by Stormbirds (http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/user/4645-stormbirds/) to take first place at the Rayleigh SC on 28th April.

Information about the event is covered briefly in my blog here - http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/blog/146/entry-515-entry-3-betrayal-in-rayleigh/

For the deck itself, the premise was to be something that could be picked up easily, but have some interesting tricks. So targeted removal combined with character removal was right up Stormbird's street!

The character base is Cultist heavy primarily for the card draw from Gustaf, with a late night addition of Fiona Day to try and sneak a win in.

I went for the standard core cards from both factions, so Khopesh and Plague Stone for removal, Flooded Vault to find them, Book of Iod for quasi-card draw, Thunder in the East and Grasping Chthonian for support removal, Corrupted Midwife and Hungry Dark Young  for character recursion.

I didn't want to go the Savio/Claret Knight/Plague Stone/Negotium combo as the deck has enough going on, and that much control could push the amount of control off the edge for newer players, which was expected for the event.

As I had only just picked up Dreamlands, I also added Vale of Pnath as it looked a good card, and it demonstrated to be a fantastic card. Anyone who is using some Shub should look at packing two copies of it without hesitation. Either it helps you out, or goes against a Dreamlands location your opponent plays that relies on them having the most and makes them work harder to make it work.
