(Quasi-)Mono-Twilight deck built around trying to use 'Calling the Darkness' to get Ancient Ones into play efficiently.

Ideal: Use Fine Dining on a 1-cost character to boost B. Ramsdale Brown's icons to allow playing Calling the Darkness with him alone. As a neat side-effect, by driving him insane you also get rid of his Fate tokens.
Alternative: Get T'ka Halot and The Rays of Dawn into play and rely on the icon boosts from Sarah and Zealous Secretary to use a Guardian of Dawn.
If you cannot get either to work, drive several characters insane and restore them using Arkham Asylum.
