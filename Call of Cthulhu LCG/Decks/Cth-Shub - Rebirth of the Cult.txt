A take on the cult theme pairing Cthulhu and Shub.

Keep it night with Savio and The Guardian. Plague Stone for backup and of course board wipes. Fiona lies dormant at a story and when she flips have her serve the Kool-Aid to your other cultists. Bring 'em all back with Dark Rebirth and Foul Induction.

This is a cultist take on a "reanimator" style of discard recall deck. The Festival was chosen as a restricted card for acceleration of shub resources and also to potentially "fix" a domain to allow you to play Dark Rebirth at it's hefty 3 loyal. Can also filter cultists into discard to set up a big recall play. Lacking Kopesh or Temple of R'yleh, Three Bells was included for a little character removal alongside Plague Stone.
