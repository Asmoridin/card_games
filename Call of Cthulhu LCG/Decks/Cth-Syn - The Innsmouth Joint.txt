Chulhu/Syndicate deck focusing on (self-)destruction to win stories in a number of 'unfair' ways (built from limited cardpool).

This is a risky deck to play. Cheap Syndicate characters need to carry the early game until you can start blowing up things. The deck features multiple ways to kill of many or all characters at stories (Ravager, Spawn, Beneath the Mire). What makes it so dangerous is the unpredicatability introduced by cards like Swimming in the Deep, Noises in the Hills and Drunken Hallucinations (used on Spawn). The same cards allow you to succeed at stories unopposed.
Descendant of Eibon and Hack Journalist can be used to turn the tides and snatch stories by surprise.
