From the moment I saw Nikola Tesla was in TKatG I wanted to build a deck around him. This is what I finally came up with! Feedback is appreciated!

Use The Festival to load your discard pile with Vortex of Time, Studying the Void, and Lost Oracle. Win arcane struggles and load Tesla up with tokens, and blow him up with Plague Stone (which you can fish out with The Guardian). Recall Tesla from the pile with Rite of the Silver Key or Corrupted Midwife and rinse/repeat.
