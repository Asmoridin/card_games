Syndicate/Yog deck focusing on skill reduction as a means to destroy characters (built from a restricted card pool).

Play aggressively, destroying characters as soon as they hit the table. Spell-bound Shoggoth is very effective in bringing everyone one step closer to being sucked into the void...
As a minor theme the deck can work well at both Day and Night.
It's weak in destroying support cards, though. Basically, there's only Melisande and Immurement.
It'll also have a hard time if Negotium hits the board.
