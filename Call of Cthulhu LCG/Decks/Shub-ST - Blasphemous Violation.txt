Strip their resources, wound their minions

Thule Zealot is the means of resource attack. Baka and Initiate of Huang Hun are the means of character denial. Unscrupulous Acquisitionist serves both ends--you play it defensively to drain a domain on your turn, hopefully denying your opponents the ability to play events or power triggers with costs, or if your opponent has drained all his domains it will return a character to his hand. The Initiate, on top forcing your opponent to return a character to his hand forces you to return one too, meaning you can replay a character with a come into play effect allowing you to ramp up the denial or make use of beneficial effects more often.



Eat the Dead, Harvesting Mi-Go, and Eat the dead are intended to help speed your resourcing while also offsetting the impact of Thule Zealot. Book of Iod  should speed your getting cards you need. Offsetting Book of Iod's discard cost are B. Ramsdale Brown and The Necronomicon (Olaus Wormius Translation), both of which speed the rate of denial in the process.
