Perfect example of how searching in WoT was crazy. Dark Disguises goes and gets a card that can’t be played on starting character.

Trolloc Horn is not only easier to use with Gyldin’s ability to convert intrigue to combat as intrigue symbols come up more often, but it continues with the idea that searching is broken.

Moghedien is so much fun with Gyldin but also opens up more searching with Need.

The characters not only recruit the troops, Halfman buffs them. Meanwhile troops try to murder as much opposing stuff as possible (or scare it off).
