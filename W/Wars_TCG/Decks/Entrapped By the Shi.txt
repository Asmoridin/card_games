# In the vastness of a new universe, there are no rules about what makes an
# alien an alien. In creating the WARS setting, the Decipher designers were
# allowed to build a game without any preconceptions about characters or
# histories or cultures. Each card and each mechanic was there to represent a
# game feature, not something that exists in a fictional setting.
# With this blank canvas before them, what, exactly, did Decipher decide
# defines an alien? One skill that only aliens in the WARS TCG universe have
# is the ability to mess with a characters tactics (the exception to this, for now,
# is the Earther Asset Advancer Research, but that only plays on Infiltrators
# and Infiltrators are vulnerable to Pursuit Just Behind if you have a ranger at a
# site. Wait, something like that). Perhaps the aliens can manipulate tactics
# because of their association with the Rift, perhaps it's because the Shi and
# the Quay needed something to set them apart from the other factions in
# game terms in the first set. Whatever the reason, a character's tactics is not
# a sacred, constant number in the WARS TCG.
# In the old Star Wars CCG, which WARS is based on and where tactics was
# called ability, not many cards could change a character's ability level. The
# Jedi tests could, and a few cards would raise the number required to draw
# destiny, but there was nothing as simple as some of the Shi and Quay cards
# that raise or lower tactics. Players making the shift from a SWCCG mindset
# to at WARS TCG mindset would be wise to check out the alien races and
# how they can manipulate characters' tactics. Perhaps one of the most
# important rules changes old players will have to learn is that even if you
# reduce your opponent's tactics at a location to zero, that opponent can still
# drain you at that location. Ability/tactics is no longer required to drain, just a
# character on one side of a viable location.
# Changing the tactics level on opponents units is representative of what the
# Shi excel at: controlling an opponent's options. It's no accident the Shi have a
# card called Controlling, which can limit drains to two locations a turn. The Shi
# weapons can control how many cards an opponent has in hand, and they
# sort of control themselves by not relying on destiny draws to succeed. Pairing
# Shi with the Maverick faction can lead to uber-powerful Shi weapons if you
# can get Slider to eliminate an opponent's hand in the first attack of a turn.
# Even on their own, the Shi like to dominate others. No big surprise there:
# they have a history of enslaving whole planets.
# Strategy
# Still, messing with tactics is a powerful strategy, and with cards like Cerebral
# Incursion, Easy Prey, and Incapacitated, the Shi are especially adept at
# messing with an opponent's tactics levels. These three cards each affect an
# opponent's tactics in different ways. Easy Prey is a lost interrupt (destiny 6,
# which is great) that doesn't actually lower a character's tactics, but it will
# exclude those tactics and a bit of a character's power and defense from a
# site battle. If your opponent is hovering at 4 tactics at a site and you want to
# bring the beatdown, Easy Prey allows you to do that.
# Incapacitated, a destiny 5 asset, is a simple way to lower any character's
# power, tactics and defense by one. Again, a location (and it could be at a
# sector this time, not just a site) where your opponent has 4 tactics is the ideal
# to spring this card and then bring an overwhelming force to teach you
# opponent what not drawing a destiny feels like when the Shi are attacking.
# Cerebral Incursion (another 6 destiny card) is an asset you play on your own
# kizen to make your opponent's tactics -4. One powerful way to use this card
# is to have a Cerebral Incursion-loaded Ranarti-Anant roaming the table in a
# ship, subtracting the tactics from opponent's sector battles across the
# universe.
# Another option is to Incursion a weak force, then use Subjugate during a
# battle with them to clean up a site in a hurry. Just be careful, because
# Incursion doesn't work where your opponent has a kizen.
# There are two ways to maximize the effectiveness of the Shi's controlling
# power, and they both rely on the truism of TCGs that says having more cards
# in hand than my opponent is a Good Thing. First, by playing lots of energy
# icons for yourself, you can activate (and then draw) more cards. Adding four
# copies of Sudeva Legionnaire to any Shi deck that relies on weapons at site
# battles should be standard. When the new Quickdraw (see Nowhere to Hide)
# characters arrive, Shi Vatarmas will be even more effective. Another way to
# keep cards in your hand is by not playing any.
# But you'll need characters on the table, and this is where the Shi power card
# Vestiges comes in. Win three battles, play any character from your lost pile
# for -3. That is effective, and keeps you ahead in the card count. During site
# battles, Anant Attendant and Fallen Ally also work well to save your
# characters with the Attendant giving everyone else at a site battle immunity
# to attrition and then Fallen Ally saving him to the used pile.
# Second, you want to prevent your opponent from having cards in hand. An
# excellent companion to the Shi weapons is Energy Conduit, which forces
# your opponent to pay energy to draw cards. For extra pleasure, include cards
# like Martial Interrogation to use up your opponent's energy (or delay a
# pending deployment) and further restrict the ways your opponent can get
# cards into hand. A few Clone Reserves might be enough to get Energy
# Conduit back into hand to continue to stymie your opponent's plans for most
# of the game. Energy Conduit, Vestiges, and Sudeva Legionnaire are all high
# destiny, too, which doesn't hurt.
# What about space? The Shi have some wonderful ships (Vatarva-Sudeva,
# for example) that Ranarti-Anant likes to pilot. Damir Aeronaut is one of the
# best and cheapest pilots in the game. The Shi ship weapons function in a
# similar way to the Vatarmas (taking cards out of hand to function), and a lot
# of the strategy of playing with the Shi comes in choosing which attacks to
# make first. Using Vatarmas at site battles to empty an opponent's hand
# makes her all the more vulnerable to a Quarrel Energy Burst. Another trick is
# to attack a lone ship using your Sudeva Escort, which makes your opponent
# lose a force, then flying Ranarti-Anant over in another ship to finish her off.
# Ripping Beam, while expensive (in effect, losing 5 energy), can take out an
# enemy ship without a destiny draw. Certainty is controlling the outcome.
# There are four locations that generate Shi support icons. Ganymede/Forward
# Base (2/1) gives power +2 at related sites when controlled by a kizen.
# Playing with Seyal/Dark Side (2/0), it would be good to start with it or by
# playing a mono-faction Shi deck, because Seyal/Dark Side gets dismissed
# unless you've planned ahead. Seyal/Light Side (2/1), is good for a Shi deck
# because it automatically provides a Shi support icon and can easily supply
# two if you have a ship there. Lastly, there is Vesta/Coveted Rock (1/1), which
# provides a +1 drain to whoever controls it.
# In the new WARS universe, Decipher has sketched the outlines of a new
# experience. For now, this place comes alive in short stories and in the few
# hundred Incursion cards. Finding the unique abilities of the Shi - and playing
# them as if they've never been played before - is one way to explore and
# shape the WARS universe. Here's a deck that takes advantage of some of
# the Shi's strengths.

# This deck should make it difficult for your opponent to keep cards in hand (or,
# if they'd rather keep them in hand, you can wipe his cards off the table with
# your weapons). It's best to fight the attacks on the ground with the Vatarmas
# before moving to space, by which time the Quarrel Energy Burst should be
# able to destroy enemy ships. Damir Aeronaut is one of the best cheap pilots
# in the game, but use its ability wisely, since it cost a lost energy to use. Make
# sure to put the Vartarnas on the Sudeva Legionnaires whenever possible to
# help with your card throughput. Once you win some fights, use Vestiges to
# get characters back from the lost pile cheaply. Use Martial Interrogation and
# Energy Conduit to make your opponent pay energy and get nothing in return.
# The locations provide you with more energy than your opponent, and feel
# free to lose some to force drains later in the game if you're generating
# enough. You don't want to help your opponent get cards into hand if you can
# avoid it.
