# I'm working on a new theory for the Quay faction: The harder to pronounce
# the title, the better the card. Unlikely, you scoff? Inconceivable? Well, they
# laughed at Columbus when he said the world was round. They said
# "Relativity? That crazy mumbo-jumbo won't fly. Now clerk my patent,
# Einstein. And get a haircut." And no one believed Pigman when he was
# trying to prove the Caine-Hackman theory (but then came "A Bridge Too
# Far"). So let's look at the Quay and try to prove this theory.
# First of all, who are the Quay? "Why, they are one of the 5 factions of the
# WARS game," you say? Well, you're right, but the smarmy answer helps
# nothing. The Quay are an alien species that focuses on their bio-engineered
# technology, just plain creepy looks and consonant clusters to intimidate and
# slice their opponents. They tunnel, they attack, they fly their life ships high.
# They have a wide array of Assets that play on sites, representing their ability
# to dig in and infest a location. Here's a look at some of the cards they use to
# accomplish this. Learn from them well and observe just how
# unpronounceable they are.
# • One of the "mains" of the Quay faction, Arhnaknak is arguably one of the
# best units in the game. To start with, a paltry 1 energy and 2 Quay Support
# Icons will get him into play. He's not much to look at (at 1/2/2). His invert
# stats are less impressive (0/4/0), and even the cost to invert him is pretty
# high (lose 3 energy). But any experienced Star Wars CCG player will tell
# you, the easiest way to sway a game is a battle with multiple battle destinies.
# Now, in WARS, we don't add extra battle destinies, we add [D] to our only
# battle destiny. And that's what Arhnaknak does. On his own, he has
# sufficient Tactics to draw a battle destiny while inverted, but with Power 0
# and Defense 0, I wouldn't recommend it. It would be better to pair him with a
# couple of high Power Kizen and some high Defense inverters for a monster
# smack down. Speaking of high powered kizen…
# The starter deck Quay Kizen, Talkan is easier to pronounce, but don't think
# that devalues him. A sturdy 3/2/6, he can become immune to attrition if
# necessary by recycling 2 cards from hand to the used pile. An excellent
# team player, Talkan can put a target character present on top of the used pile
# to make him power +2. Though this can only be used once per turn, it is
# incredibly useful. If you're losing a high-destiny character for attrition, put
# him back in your deck. Recycle a 0 or 1 power character for a minor power
# boost. If you don't have enough energy for a Makal Shrieker, why not send
# that 6 back into your deck?
# "Luhus" has such a soft sound, that when combined with "mauler" it comes
# out "loose-moller" in frantic game play. However, inverting allows their stats
# to remain roughly the same, and as an added bonus, they can DAMAGE
# ANY UNIT. Defense, power, destiny? A Mauler cares not for these things.
# True, this is a one time shot, but since their power drops to 1 after inverting,
# they can be easily recycled by Talkan. A handy copy of The Beckoning can
# help, too.
# Suffering the same problem as the Luhus Mauler, the "loose-dal-acka" is a
# quagmire of a name. And, also like the Luhus Mauler, they can get around
# normal weapon mechanics (damage if destiny<[D], or some variation thereof)
# to damage a unit. If you're willing and able to pay [D] energy, you can
# damage any unit with Defense <5. Now, that's not too high a defense, but
# the guaranteed damaging makes up for it.
# Hounded. This card is impossible to pronounce! Come on! How-oon-ded?
# Hon-deed? Can human beings even physically make the sounds necessary
# to pronounce this?
# Ok, fine. This is the exception that proves my rule (I also call "no-disproving
# me" for infinity). Again, another card that by-passes a unit's defense and
# requires no destiny to destroy them, just a higher power character moving to
# it's location. Though the Quay suffer from a lack of vehicles, this card can
# synergize well with an Earther-Quay combo deck, allowing you to move
# multiple characters using a Vehicle's Transport keyword and conserve the
# energy needed to play Hounded.
# Combining all of these cards and strategies, we can come up with this deck,
# which combines the cards into a single dense block of tongue-tying fun:

# This deck is a mix of ground and space, allowing you to choose which to
# focus on on the fly. Don't try to maximize both, run offensively one (most
# likely ground) and defensively on the other. Tunnels is fantastic for moving
# your units during the Deploy phase, a move that surprises the heck out of
# your opponent. For another great move, pick a supposrt weenie and that
# your opponent has pending and play Portent to bring right to your Quay for
# an early supper. Make good use of placing high destinies in your support
# pile as well, you've got plenty of great cards to do it with.
# So there you have it. The Quay may have some hard to pronounce card
# titles, but the abilities more than make up for it. Thanks for reading and look
# forward to my next article, in which I'll tackle a follow-up to this theory: is the
# number of times you have to try to pronounce a card title equal to the exact
# number of copies you should have in your deck?
