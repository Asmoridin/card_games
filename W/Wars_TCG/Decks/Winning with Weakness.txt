# Trying to get gamers to pick up a new game can be a difficult, believe me I
# know. With a low number of players in my area I run a lot of demos to try
# and recruit new players and the excuse that I hear most often is that people
# don't have the money to get into a new game. With WARS this is no excuse
# at all, because the game was designed with draft in mind and many of the
# most powerful cards in the game are common or uncommon so, it is quite
# possible to build a tournament-worthy deck with only a few rare cards in it.
# One deck type that can win games built out of mostly C/UC cards focuses on
# the low cost Earther and Shi Kizen, and the beatstick that is Chindon Relk.
# This guy has turned a lot of heads and he's always a good choice in draft;
# Relk gives you extra attrition all by himself, but when you put him down on a
# planet that has other Kizen running around, he is a sure way to clear a site.
# Although this strategy is very strong there is another great deck that you can
# build with only a few rare cards involved and that is the deck we are going to
# look at today.

# This great deck has only one rare card in it but it is for the best as a few
# copies of Luhustika will help your drains immensely. The key to this deck is
# Chuluktika, the activated ability on this card lets you bounce your vehicles all
# over the planet as many times in a turn as you like as long as you have the
# energy for it. Start out by drawing cards until you have gotten some of your
# support icons out and a few ships in hand. Take strong hold on the
# Ganymede system (you have lots of ships that can destroy/damage other
# ships so it should be no problem holding down this system). Then, in the
# control phase, bounce your vehicle over all the Ganymede sites draining at
# every one, with Luhustika on the table these drains will add up fast. Always
# save enough energy left in your pile so that if the opponent deploys and tries
# to engage your vehicle you can move it away with Chuluktika, make sure you
# move away in their deploy phase because you cannot use your ability in the
# battle phase.
# Attack Plan is included to invert your Rugged Empty to get an extra drain at
# Traginium Source, or it can be used with the Sloops to destroy any infiltrator
# ships that may be blocking your drains. Phobos should not be deployed
# unless you know they are playing very little space and you can be sure that
# you can hold it as well as Ganymede, otherwise it may come back to haunt
# you as your opponent retrieves off your site. You should encamp Ganymede
# with a Maverick encampment so that you can invert your Death Dealers
# there. The Quay Navigators are included to block any large drains your
# opponent gets going and are safer than using the infiltrator ships because
# they are not vulnerable to Pursuit Just Behind. Some people might be afraid
# to build a deck without the safety of Trumped, but the interrupts in this deck
# are not vital to your game plan. Fifth Ace can come in handy when you need
# to invert your Sloops and Attack Plan is also helpful, but neither of them are
# critical. Aggressive Stance will hinder your opponent without hurting you any
# so it is a nice card to add in as well.
# A high amount of energy activation is crucial for this deck in order to do a
# good amount of damage with drains on your turn and to prevent your vehicle
# from getting a beatdown on the opponent's turn. Once you are up and
# running you should be activating 12- 13 energy off your sites alone, but if you
# find that is not enough you can always make room for Rising Morale to boost
# your activation. If you find you need to kill the opponent faster then Revenge
# is a great uncommon to do some direct damage, or you could use the
# Gongen Stockpile asset to help you in this area.
# If you can get a few extra rare cards then Alnak Station/Hallway is a good
# one to have as well as Alnak herself. You could swap out some ships for a
# small ground force and hold down a site with Alnak on it to give your
# opponent even more pain from your drains. This deck is a great example of
# the power of commons and uncommon cards in WARS and should be a
# great reason to get people into the game even if they say they can't afford it.
# As you can see, it won't cost a lot to build a tournament competitive deck.
# Plus, it is always fun to watch your opponents face when they realize that
# their deck full of Jacks and Gamblers just lost to a deck with only one rare in
# it. Play around with it and change it until it suits the needs of your area, and
# always have fun
