# 24 TCG — Official Rulebook

<!-- page 2 -->

## 24 Trading Card Game Rules Of Play
Welcome to the 24 Trading Card Game! With this exciting new game, you can relive the thrills and action of the hit TV show 24. Will you join Jack Bauer and CTU and foil the terrorist plot? Or will you conspire with the terrorists and infiltrators in the effort to undermine national security or start a war?

What is a Trading Card Game?
A Trading Card Game (TCG) is like a traditional card game, except that each player creates and builds his own deck from the cards in his collection, so no two games ever play exactly the same. Some cards are more rare than others, too, making it both a collectible and a game. You can buy, sell, and trade your cards with other players, all to
build the perfect deck!

## The Basics

### Object
The object of the game is to score 24 points, usually by completing "missions" with your characters.

### Card Types
There are five card types in the 24 TCG: directive, character, equipment, agenda, and event

<!-- page 3 -->

### Directive

![Directive card example](../assets/images/directive_card.png)

You begin the game with a directive in play face up on the table in front of you. It is not considered part of your 24-card deck. Your directive tells you what side you're playing (CTU or Insurgents) and often has an ability that gives you a focus for your deck

Alignments:
- CTU
- Insurgents

Card Elements:
- A: Title
- B: Game Text
- C: Alignment

### Character

![Character card example](../assets/images/character_card.png)

A character has a title, a subtitle, a cost, an alignment, a specialty, game text, and two attributes.

**Skill** is a measure of a character’s ability and is the primary factor in determining success or failure in missions. **Health** is a measure of how many wounds a character can take before being killed.

Card Elements:
- A: Title (and Subtitle)
- B: Cost
- C: Alignment
- D: Specialty
- E: Skill
- F: Health
- G: Traits, Keywords, and Game Text
- H: War Number
