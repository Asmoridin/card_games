#This is kind of a tower deck : you have big, big guys. You have one of the best printed SH battle action. 
#Wait him, get him, smash him. Don't be greedy, don't be too eager. Don't be gun shy either. Be calm, and win.
#You are immensely good in opposed battles (plenty red cards, tactician, printed strong) so there's a decent chance "anything you got versus anything I got" will be in your favor. if no now, the next turn. 
#You lose if your opponent wins too fast (eg : runs a political rocket), and that where the tacticians shine : anyone of these 6 guys, naked, is a province eater versus most rocket decks. Drop a turn 2 ayameko to a phoenix deck, and watch him freak out.
#Versus Militaries : you have high PS, resilient guys, plenty red cards : there are no free "I throw 8F naked at your province" lunches here. Make him sweat a little, make it expensive to him.
