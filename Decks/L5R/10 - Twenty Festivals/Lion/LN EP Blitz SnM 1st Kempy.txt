#Idea is to aggressive cycle for any Personality 1st round, especially for Matsu Akio. Then buy Holding or two. If there's none, just go for Legacy. Drop anything from Provinces except at least 1 Personality and cheap 1 for 1 Holding or The Blessing. 2nd turn buy Peronality, maybe with additional Holding. Third turn attack depends of board situation and hand. For most time you'll have to equip item and swing. Combo of Shadow of the Dark God (Permanently -1PS) and Fight on Your Back (5F as Tactical Advantage!) sometime will allow to destroy Province on cost of 1 card from hand. If there's an Defender you have option to bow with Imperial Summons (that's why there's Auspicious Arrival). If there's Ominous Blessing, just search for The Heavens Are Watching to flip up all Provinces and prepare for best sniping. Destroying one or two Provinces creates huge advantage, and if your hand is empty or weak, you can easily sacrifice a turn to buy Holdings for more resources. Count carefuly number of your guys in play and discard, ther're only 10 of them!
