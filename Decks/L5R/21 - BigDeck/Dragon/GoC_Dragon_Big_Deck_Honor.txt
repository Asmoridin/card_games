That's 52 people. I built the deck to run at 50, so you can cut whichever two you want. I'd hoped to go with a few spells (like the Wasting Disease combo) but it looks like that's not happening. If there are any good Dragons with less than a 3PH you're going to have to find them. Also Daigotsu Oki is always an option.
