This is the deck I used at the UK National's on 6th September 2015 at GTG Games &amp; Hobbies.

I went 3-2 (with my first game being an automatic victory due to winning a regional), and ended up 3rd in Swiss overall. I won the semi-final, but was defeated by MulletCheese in the final, with his deck found here - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/callofcthulhu/call-of-cthulhu-decks/_/call-of-cthulhu-decks/2015-uk-national-winner-r149

I recorded all of my games, and they shall be detailed along with further information within my blog here - http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/blog/146-diary-of-an-investigator/

Certain cards pulled their weight more than others, with cards such as Servant to the Elder Things and Fishers from Outside not being played all day.

If you have any questions or comments to make, please do as I will happily talk about my decks :)
