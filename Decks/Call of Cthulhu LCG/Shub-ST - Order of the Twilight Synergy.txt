Works well as a rush deck, can come out fast early to grab a quick story or 2, switches tempo by turn 4 and goes nuts with B Ramsdale Brown. 

Depending on how many Nexus you want to play you can Huang multiple times to keep triggering Ramsdales to keep playing you know too much or Ice Shafts over and over again. 

Once the board is clear, drop some 3 cost guys to mop up the last story.
