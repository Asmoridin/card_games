Lots of cultist to sacrifice, mostly to Carl Stanford and Harbinger of Insanity. The Carpathian, Gustaf Johansen and Cyclopean stone to take advantage. And khopesh for removal, ideally attached on a stolen character.

Not sure about Demon Lover. The lover should help with the Harbinger and Somnambulant Dreamer. And I should probably find a better way of recurring cultists (foul induction is pretty expensive though)
