    Deck I took to the Gatineau Regionals today. 
Had 1 bye, loss the 2nd round vs. Shub ramp, beat Hastur Control and Cthulhu rush. Beat Yog recursion at time in T4 in an incredibly close match littered with a TON of mistake on both sides (but mostly me) and then lost to Hastur/Syndicate rush control deck. But he was indeed undefeated for the day.

The idea was that festival would fix your coloured ressources and Ramsdale would get the cards back. Claret Knight + Plaguestone control. Recursion with Midwife.

Deck was a steaming pile of crap and built on the car ride to the event. Amazing I made it that far. While getting to the finals was an impressive feat, I didn't deserve a win as much as my opponent did.
