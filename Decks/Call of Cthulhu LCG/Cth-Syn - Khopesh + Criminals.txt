A variation on http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/callofcthulhu/call-of-cthulhu-decks/_/call-of-cthulhu-decks/khopesh-of-the-university-4th-gtg-store-championship-r5, where I wondered how the deck would work if I switched to Syndicate, primarily to make the most out of Dutch Courage.

The one issue I do have is the noticeable change in icons, with the lesser amount of Arcane and Investigation. That is why the replacements try to have similar icons/abilities.

Marine Salvager helps replace Elijah Conrad for getting back my Flooded Vaults, as well as any other support cards I may lose.

Danny O'Bannion's Office acts as a quasi-alternative to College Prospect, as when the Khopesh bearer is finally destroyed, I will get a card from them. In the long term I may be better off, but only testing will tell. Not being able to search for it with the Vault is an issue however.

Combining the abusive factor of Khopesh with Made Man on one of the criminals allows me to get round their Invulnerable or high Toughness characters, which I have previously found an issue (Cthulhu Carl Stanford most recently).

The deck was built from a pool of 3x core set, all the deluxe boxes and Shifting Sands.
