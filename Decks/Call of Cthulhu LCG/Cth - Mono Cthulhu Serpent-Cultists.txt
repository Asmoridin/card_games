Add Disguised Threat?

The key to this deck is abusing Temple of R'lyeh with Sibilant Cry, Foul Induction and Uroborus' recursion effects. Padma Amrita with Disguised Threat can be used to quickly get Cthylla into play to achieve the same effect as Temple of R'lyeh, and Silver Twilight Temptress' ability can be used to get rid of your opponent's characters by subjecting them to your better icons.

Deep One Assault gets rid of anything that might be hindering your plans like Flux Stabilizer, and a complete board wipe of anything cost 3 or lower can be used with Uroborus with The Necronomicon.
