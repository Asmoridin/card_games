Designed to rush stories quickly with Syndicates heavy hitters (Pan, St Claire and Peter) with some soft control in the form of key Hastur cards.  The resourcing was sometimes a challenge with the amount of neutral cards but you always tend to have the ability to play what you need.  Alienist was usually used once Stygian Eye was in play or resourced.

Overall finished 4-0 after beating Agency/Hastur discard, Shub ramp, a tough tri-faction with Shub, yog and I think syndicate and the bye in the swiss.  Then defeated the Agency/Hastur in the semi and a tri-faction Misc/Shub and Yog deck in the final.

MVP was Hack Journalist.  He won me two games by himself.
