Agency Rush deck. Cheap characters with some supportive firepower...
Get Obsessive detective out, and put him in an armoured car.
Have relentless Stalker help him punch some face, and never uncommit them.
Paul Lemonde should help soak up terror icons and Clarney removes toughness.
Shotgun blast for sniping, Sister Sofia for extra wound giving...
Simple and elegant IMHO...
