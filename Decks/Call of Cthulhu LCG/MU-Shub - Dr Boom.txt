    3x Pervasive Toxemia (The Thousand Young)

    So I loved the decklist that Yipe put together for Portland (I'd been trying something similar, but to far lesser success) but with the FAQ and the ruling update on Pervasive Toxemia and August Lindquist, I thought I'd try something different

    Same strategy as Yipe's list, but using Dr Bancroft to assign wounds.  In addition, I've added the Explorer card-advantage suite (including Roald as a pseudo-BRB) and Ghouls for a way to add a jumper into the deck, as well as use some of the newer cards.  I've had some successful testing but it's still early.
