    The main impetus of the deck is the interaction between Claret Knight and Savio's immunity and cards like The Plague Stone, The Three Bells, and Sacrificial Offering.  The several other characters with Immunity (Black-Winged One, Carl, and Y-Golonac) are also neat with Sacrificial Offering too.  The rest of the characters/cultists are there to feed Carl, run interference, and just generally muck about with your opponent's plans while you out control them with a series of board wipes, removal and recursion.
