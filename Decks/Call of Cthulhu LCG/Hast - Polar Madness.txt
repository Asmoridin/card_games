The discard pile needs to be primed with a polar event card to allow the other cards to start doing damage.  The conspiracy allows that to happen if you happen to lose a icon struggle and it is night.  Frequently, my opponent left the conspiracy alone, and I did not want to win it because of Crazy Eddie and 'Ol Lazy Eyes conspirator abilities.  I did not get that combination out often, or quickly.

Things learned:

The penguins do not give enough card draw.
Need a better discard method, to prime the polar events.... leaning towards Yog-Sothoth and / or Silver Twilight over Hastur.
This is a slow deck, with a lot of events.  It is also very defensive, especially if "The Night" is out because that changes a lot of icon math.

What is going on in the antarctic?  A group of inept relic hunters and students investigate the conspiracy.

Trying to see if a "polar" deck can be fun and semi-competent within our group.
