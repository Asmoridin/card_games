    It's everyone's favorite subtype featured in a deck I feel can be quite strong. The addition of Mi-Go Worker and the new unique Mi-Go (don't ask me to type out its name) really goes a long way in addressing the tempo problems the subtype suffered.

Savio Corvi, The Claret Knight, The Guardian, and Plague Stone all form a powerful core to this deck which the Mi-Gos compliment. Your basic strategy is to crank out Mi-Gos, get Savio and The Guardian in play, wipe the board with Plague Stone, then play Dark Rebirth to bring all of your Mi-Gos back into play. Use the Mi-Go Skull to crown your Claret Knight "King of the Mi-Gos" (you should shout this when you play the card. All hail the King. Long live the King.) and turn him into an absolute juggernaut. The Festival was chosen as the deck's restricted card for its ability to ramp up your resourcing to get you into Plague Stone plays quicker, and also it can shuffle mi-gos into your discard pile for big Dark Rebirth plays.

Questions and comments as always are welcome.
