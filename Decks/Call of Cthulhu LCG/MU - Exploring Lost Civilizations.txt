A mono MU deck I built for a friend for the Stoke regional, but sadly was unable to go.

It was inspired after getting destroyed on OCTGN by Florian using a similar deck with a larger card pool.

Built around Explorers, Faculty and Students, the deck is built around abusing bouncing Explorers with Ultima Thule and Roald Ellsworth.

Political Demonstration was added to give me some form of Support hate, which isn't as immediate as I would like, but can be triggered enough from lots of Arcane/Investigation.

Nothing truly revolutionary in it, but gets the job done :)

This was built from a pool of 3x core, all deluxes, Words of Power, Shifting Sands and Dunwich Denziens (which doesn't add anything).
