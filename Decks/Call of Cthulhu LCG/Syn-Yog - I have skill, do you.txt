This is a rush deck, trying to get most story struggles to become skill checks (Mr. David Pan, Parallel Universe, Hatchet Man, O'Bannion's Inner Council). Fthaggua becomes a skill powerhouse when a character is destroyed. Hanyatl's 12:3 is used with concrete and chains, and Lena to trick in the higher cost syndicate characters.

Ideal starting hand has cannibal ghost, Lena, and Eldritch Nexus in it. Remember, Lena can still icons and skills from your characters, multiple times if you have the domains available.

Preferable, no domain will go above three, and that the domains are an even mix of Yog and Syndicate.

Hatchet Man and David Pan - Go to 3?
