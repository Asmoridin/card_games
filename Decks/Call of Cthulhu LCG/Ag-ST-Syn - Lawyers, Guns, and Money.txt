    This is a little theme deck I threw together based around one of my favorite combos: criminals+La Bella Luna+day.

Keep your opponent's characters from going to stories with Trial Judge, Behind Bars, and exhaustion effects. If you have La Bella Luna and a day effect (San Marco Basilica or Crooked Attorney) in place, Unending Festivities can really put the clamp down on your opponent while your criminals stay frosty and ready to defend. When characters do get through, pop in Master of Myths for his excellent blocking abilities.

While I don't think this deck would win Worlds or Gencon, I think it could do very well at your local tournaments. Some tweaks to the cost curve could be made to make it a little more competitive, I suspect.
