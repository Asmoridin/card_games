Get Logan into play with a couple of guns and a bike to take control of stories and kill a few opponents along the way (built from limited card pool).

Local Sheriff and Seeker of Mysteries are there to get Logan into play early. If you don't draw Logan, use A Call For Help.
Preferred attachments are Lightning Gun and Military Bike, unless the situation calls for something else.
Most of the other characters are there to delay and make life difficult for the opponent.
The rest is there to protect Logan and his stuff or help get him back quickly, should he be forced to leave play in some way (Plague Stone, Immurement, Mage's Machinations, ...)
The deck likely doesn't have the right balance, yet. I also had to cut a lot of cards to get it down to 50, e.g. Working a Hunch, which would have proved useful quite a few times already.
