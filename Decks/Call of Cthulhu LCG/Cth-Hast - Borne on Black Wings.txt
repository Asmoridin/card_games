Everything revolves around Terror.  A Scheme of Byakhees and The King in Yellow Folio not only help win Terror struggles, they also increase the number of Terror struggles that occur.  Scheme, Drawing the Sign, and Brother of the Black Lotus all provide additional benefits to winning as many Terror struggles as possible.  Cthulhu cards provide versatility at stories to accentuate your Terror dominance and shore up your weaknesses.

Your key cards are all able to be tutored to some degree:

A Scheme of Byakhees (with Shrieking Byakhee)
Hastur (with Broken Space, Broken Time)
Hastur support cards (Danni Devine)

Hastur + A Scheme of Byakhees = coup de grace
