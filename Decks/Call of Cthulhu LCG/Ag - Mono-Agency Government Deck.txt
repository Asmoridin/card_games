The idea behind this deck is to use the cards introduced in the For the Greater Good deluxe expansion.

The main strategy is to be able to play the Government characters cheaply by utilising Special Agent Clarkston this will enable me to play New Recruit and Officer Gibson for free and the rest of the two cost Government characters by paying only 1 resource. Combine with Lieutenant Wilson Stewart and a strong presence of Government character on the board, I hope to play The Foundation in the mid-game.  

Trial Judge + San Marco Basilica, Government Exorcist and Behind Bars help me to control opponents from committing to stories.  I like the combo of Government Exorcist and then play Behind Bars which can significantly prevent some strong characters to defend against my attack at a story.
I am unsure whether to have Political Demonstration or Torch the Joint! so I include 1 copy of each of them to deal with Location support cards.

The weakness of this deck is the lack of Arcane icons and hopefully Attache can be played early in the mid-game. 

Despite having no-conspiracy card, I included Pious Carabiniere mainly for his icons and Willpower.
