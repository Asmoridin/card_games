Mono-Shub deck with a Cthonian theme focusing on story denial.

Originally this deck also featured Shudde-M'ell, but Y'Golonac is simply so much better!
Ideally, the starting hand should feature Negotium (or a way to bring it into the game, e.g. Ol' Lazy Eyes or The Red-Gloved Man) and cost reducers (Ghoulish Worshipper, One of the Thousand, Priestess of Bubastis).
Shocking Transformation will most often be used to get Savio Corvi into the game. Slavering Gug can also be useful in the late game, after building one or two domains with 4+ resources.
Originally, the deck also featured Arkham Inmate for the hilarious combo with Binding Worm, but it got replaced by the Descendant, who is simply so much better.
The Deck's a bit weak on Arcane and Investigation, hence Y'Golonac and Ancient Guardian, and Descendant and Mi-Go Surgeon who may also be attractive targets for a Shocking Transformation.
