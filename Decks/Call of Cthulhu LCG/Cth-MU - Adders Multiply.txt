Miskatonic scholars in league with serpents. A perfect balance of icons, with mutating serpent icons to boot.

Keep two domains at one (for cheap characters and events) and build one to four, for 9 different cost-4 characters, and 3x The Sleeper Awakens! Eight zero-cost attachments facilitate using The Sleeper Awakens! to level opposing characters while keeping your own.

Eldritch Nexus gets an extra domain for pays on mutating serpent icons. Rabbit's Foot is mostly for extra cards in hand. Disguised Threat can turn Faculty Advisors into heavy serpents for cheap.

This deck has served me well, even when I was playing sloppily.
