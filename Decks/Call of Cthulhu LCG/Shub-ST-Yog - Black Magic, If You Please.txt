    This is my second experimental deck after playing a few more games and working through the deckbuilding process.  It's straightforward control with some fast weenies to grab some success tokens before slapping down Negotium so I can mop up with some of the bigger guys.  There's a lot of stuff to deal with characters (Many-Angled Thing, Rite, Pushed, etc), and a few ways to steal contested stories like Mind Swap and Steal The Soul.  Master of Myths and Black Dog are there to stall and early rush, and I think most of it is pretty self explanatory.
