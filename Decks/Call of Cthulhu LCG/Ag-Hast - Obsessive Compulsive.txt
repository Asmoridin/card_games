    This deck utilizes the powerful combo between Unending Festivities and The 70 Steps to keep your opponent's characters locked down and unable to commit to stories. Trial Judge,  Behind Bars, and Cavern of Flame all add additional ways to keep your opponent off stories. Obsessive Detective, Obsessive Inmate, and Relentless Stalker can all "stick" at stories to help your deck better overcome the restrictions from Unending Festivities, and San Marco Basilica also helps to keep your characters frosty. Guardian Pillar was chosen as the deck's restricted card for its ability to ignore Unending Festivities and for the strong story defense it provides should any characters get through.

An ideal starting hand will contain A copy of the 70 Steps and either a copy of Unending Festivities or Ol' Lazy Eyes plus the means to play them turn one (at least one Hastur resource). Mulligan anything short of this. You will always want to elect to play first given the choice with this deck.

Comments and feedback always welcome.
