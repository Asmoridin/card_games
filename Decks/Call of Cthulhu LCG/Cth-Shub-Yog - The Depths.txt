Just brought this deck to the Cthulhu night in Portland and went 4-0. Kind of a revision of my Temple regionals deck. The idea is to force your opponent to trigger one of your dormant cards with Will of Azathoth and other tricks, get some cultists for free, and eventually clear his board with Cthylla/Tulzcha. Almost (if not) every game I played I got out both Ancient Ones, it was ridiculous. Supernal Prism was actually really great for this deck, I put it in so I could tutor it with Flooded Vault in response to a Plague Stone. Didn't see any the other night, but since you can usually play out most of your hand for free, triggering the Prism is usually better for you than your opponent. I don't think people have given Dormant cards the credit they deserve, but with this deck it's really pretty easy to create a situation that's just really bad for your opponent pretty easily. Try it out, see what you think. The only problem with this deck is that it's a little slow. But it's really good at stalling too, so just be patient, something will always come...FROM THE DEPTHS!!!
