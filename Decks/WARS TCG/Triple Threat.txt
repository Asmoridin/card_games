# In a previous article we took a look at multi faction decks, why people would
# want to play them and how to balance the two factions. Today we are going
# to take that a step further and look at three faction decks, something that has
# become quite popular at high level tournaments. While we all anxiously
# awaited the release day of WARS, much of the talk on the message boards
# speculated that 2 faction decks would be the strongest and that 3 or more
# factions would be too unreliable. At Essen we saw differently however as
# there were some 3 faction decks present in the top 16 as well as a 4 faction
# deck. More recently at GenCon SoCal 3 faction decks reigned supreme, and
# now it seems that 2 faction decks just won't cut it at a high level tournament.
# Building a 3 faction deck is no easy task without the right balance you could
# end up with a recipe for disaster. After telling Arthur that I wanted to do a
# follow up to my multi faction deck article by writing this article it struck me
# that I didn't have the slightest clue where to start when it came to building or
# playing a 3 faction deck. I needed information and there was only one place
# or should I say one person to go to, the Infobroker, after all he did win
# GenCon SoCal with a 3 faction deck so he must know something about
# them.
# I talked to Tim about 3 faction decks and the mechanics of them in a brief
# email and he gave me some tips that sent me on my way. After toying
# around with a few variations I found something that could pass for a
# tournament level deck.

# When you are dealing with a 3 faction deck there are a few ways you can
# approach the problem of getting all your SI out. One way is to start a site
# that provided all the SI you need for one faction and then you only have to
# worry about the two others. I considered starting the Underground Bunker
# but seeing as I have few Gongen cards I decided against it and instead
# started the Quay site because the Quay make up most of my deck. The
# deck uses 3 Maverick SI, 2 Gongen SI, and mostly 2 Quay SI, only Reaping
# has 3 SI on it for my Quay side but I felt that in this all ground deck it would
# be needed. This deck may be a little overzealous in the SI area but I feel it
# still works well. The deck is aptly named Hydra after the multi headed
# creature of legend, the trick is to not get your 3 heads crossed or you may
# end up hurting yourself. Many people will run one 3 SI faction one using only
# 2 SI and the third only using 1 SI, this way will make it much easier to get the
# cards you need out and if u can pull it off the less SI you need the better. A
# deck sporting a main 3 SI faction and 2 factions using only 1 SI would also
# fare well; it's just a matter of finding the balance you work best with.
# This deck is sheer ground control, if it comes to a fight on the ground your
# heavy hitters tunneling around should have no problems winning fights and
# denying your opponent battle destiny by using cards like Kayaldi, Cloak of
# Fear, Tahka Disruptor, and Natural Talent. Add to the fact that you will be
# drawing 2 destinies with Ahrnaknak and you will soon find yourself in healthy
# control of the ground. At this point you can spread out and finish them off
# with Alnak enhancing the drains and a few well timed Reaping to put the pins
# in them.
# Against a mono space deck you should have no problem winning the drain
# race with all the sites included your Reaping can get quite large if left
# unchecked, and Alnak again will be giving your opponent headaches.
# Well there is a quick look at a triple faction deck and a few helpful tips; you
# are well on your way to mastering the triple threat deck.
