# With today's release of the WARS TCG, I set out to create a WARS deck that
# would give new players a feel for the game, but without a lot of the
# complicated card interactions that one tends to find in competitive decks. I
# also wanted to make the deck consist of cards from entirely one faction,
# thereby allowing new players to see how factions have strengths and
# weaknesses. Ultimately, I decided to focus on the Earther faction. The way I
# saw it, I've spent all my living years on Earth, so I should know more about
# these guys than anybody else, right?
# As can be gathered by glancing through the Incursion card list and
# comments by the game designers, the Earther faction is more about muscle
# than manipulation. They're your run-of-the-mill military. Well, almost. I've
# created a deck list that emphasizes Earther muscle; there are quite a few
# characters (mostly ground units) and a nice complement of vehicles and
# ships:


# Locations (7):
1 Earth/Corporate Headquarters (starting)
1 Earth/Humanity's Home
2 Ganymede/Exploratory Camp
2 Ganymede/Hunters' Camp
1 Luna/Military Outpost
# Characters (19):
2 Chan Whitmer
1 Ivan McCarr
1 Pavel Royerk
2 Horatio Hicks
1 Consigned Trooper
2 Grav Operator
2 Infantry Officer
3 Vanguard Trooper
3 Close Support Pilot
2 Veteran Pilot
# Vehicles (5):
2 GR-Blade
1 Howler's Blades
2 Infantry Support Vehicle
# Ships (8):
1 Seyaltika
1 Tahka Quarrel
1 Inca 1
1 Inca 2
1 Atlantis
1 Luna Garrison Fighter
1 Escort Cruiser
1 Salvaged Transport
# Assets (8):
2 Advanced Research
1 Fighter Support
1 First Aid
2 Slippery
2 Recovery
# Weapons (5):
2 LongBow Missile 27-B
3 Sidearm
# Interrupts (8):
4 Collaborative Strike
2 Hostilities Unleashed
2 Syndicate Interference


# Strategy
# This deck is designed to do most of its fighting and draining at site locations,
# as is evident by the relatively small number of ships and pilots. For setting up
# your army, Vanguard Trooper is great. Not only does he have a 4 destiny,
# but his ability, which is free, lets you play a unit at a related site for 1 less
# energy. Both Infantry Officer and Grav Operator are small units, but they get
# power boosts if you have characters with tactics greater than 2 and 4,
# respectively. This won't be a problem as several of your unique Earthers
# satisfy these requirements. Let me also say a word about ammunition
# because there is some good stuff in this deck. Both the LongBow Missile 27-
# B (for ships) and the Sidearm (for characters) are great choices. They both
# have destinies of 4 and cause +1 attrition at their locations. In addition, they
# both have abilities that let you damage your opponent's ships.
# Ships? Yeah, couldn't keep that hidden for long could I? The thing is, as
# much as I wanted to put all of my efforts into site domination, it's just too
# much of a risk to have a deck devoid of space fighters. Looking closely at the
# ships you'll notice that there are a few Quay fighters (Seyaltika, Tahka
# Quarrel). I know, the deceptions keep coming - I said the deck was going to
# be all Earther. Still, as much as I wanted to have a unified army, I'm always
# willing to do a bit of splashing in order to expand on a tactical theme. The
# theme in question revolves around the Infiltrator keyword. Many of the unique
# Earthers are Infiltrators (Chan Whitmer, Ivan McCarr, Pavel Royerk) and they
# enable you to play the asset Slippery. This card, although it has a costly 1
# destiny, prevents either player from attacking at the site of its bearer
# (provided he/she is an Infiltrator and you only have Infiltrators at that site).
# This is a great way to prevent your opponent from causing you a painful
# energy drain. The equivalent of this ability at a sector is the Quay asset,
# Recovery - thus the need for a few Quay ships. The Earther faction is very
# limited when it comes to manipulating the battlefield, so I really couldn't pass
# up this ability.
# I'd like to end this article with a discussion of the deck's Interrupts. All three
# have the commonality of being high destiny (4 or 5) cards with relatively
# small costs. Collaborative Strike is a great 5 destiny used interrupt that
# makes your unit +4 power and +4 defense if it has a weapon. For Earther
# brute force, this is an all around great card. Speaking of brute force,
# Hostilities Unleashed is also a 5 destiny interrupt, and although it is lost after
# its use, the loss is worth it. The card lets you initiate an attack (for free) at a
# location where a battle has already taken place. That's two attacks for the
# price of the interrupt (3 Earther icons and the payment of 2 energy). Finally,
# # there is the glorious Syndicate Interference. It is another 4 destiny used
# interrupt, but this one's special because it gives your Earthers some added
# manipulation. Basically, if you are about to get drained at a site, your
# opponent must pay 1 energy for each unit they have there or dismiss that
# unit.
# Although there's nothing particularly tricky about this deck, it's a good look
# into the Earther faction. What's really great is that although Earthers
# specialize in direct assault strategies, they still have a handful of tricks at
# their disposal. You'll find this subtlety in all the factions of the WARS TCG -
# it's one of the main reasons this game is so much fun play
