# When one first looks at WARS, it is clear that one good way to go would play
# a deck exclusively featuring one factions cards and perhaps some
# independent cards. Yeah, this allows you to use one single support icon and
# lots of them. However, many factions have things they are missing which can
# be filled well by another faction. Thus, playing multiple factions might be
# advisable in some cases.
# Lets take the Shi for example. The Shi have a large number of Kizen that
# tend to have some really nice abilities and good stats as well as a number of
# cards, like Celebrated. They also have good pilots and warriors that give you
# lots of power for low cost. Shi fighters are arguably the best out there giving
# big power numbers for a moderate cost. Shi also have a number of cards
# that key off of you having a character with a weapon under them, Ordinance
# Master for one. However Shi weapons tend to be a bit quirky and unreliable
# and don't always do what they are meant to do. Shi also lack powerful
# capital ships and totally lack vehicles in Incursion.
# Enter the Earther faction. These guys, while having a few Kizen of their own,
# don't have the kind of cards to go with them that the Shi do. They also have
# big nasty vehicles and capital ships that pack a serious punch. They also
# have weapons that can damage opposing forces with frightening regularity.
# With these things they fill in a lot of the gaps that the Shi possess while
# adding some more of what the Shi possess, namely cards that feed off of
# having available weapons. Thus we have an perfect marriage of two factions
# that are quite effective on their own.
# Now, having two factions in a deck also poses a few challenges. First is
# Support Icons. It gets a bit trickier when you have to provide multiple support
# icons for more then one faction. Two simple adjustments can be made to
# offset this problem. If you are only using a faction for a handful of cards in a
# deck, like giving a few Earther guns to the Shi, then you can simply limit the
# cards from the secondary faction to ones with one or two SIs. F.L.I.Cs for
# example only have one SI and work great in warrior heavy Shi Decks. If you
# want to play multiple SI cards from both factions though, you'll have to find a
# way to get those SIs out there. Best method I can think of, Expansion.
# Expansion basically lets you pull whatever SI you happen to be lacking at the
# moment. The independent Transports and Bots are also a great way to get
# those extra SIs when you need them.
# The deck below is designed to illustrate many of these principles. Its
# designed to be fast, hard hitting, and slightly spooky at times. Let the WARS
# begin.

# Strategy
# This deck is all about power in its rawest form and the pinnacle of power in
# WARS lies in Kizen. Virtually all the characters in this deck are Kizen,
# Warriors, or both. Those that aren't Kizen can be made into Kizen quite
# easily using Metamorphose. Those that are can gain the benefits of several
# powerful cards that enhance the already powerful Kizen and make them into
# unstoppable machines.
# When looking at what sites to focus on in this deck, the choices should be
# quite clear. Ganymede/Forward Base is critical as holding it with a Kizen will
# give you a major advantage in battles elsewhere on the moon. Your other
# main focus should be on Ganymede/Core Shaft where you can drain hard to
# your hearts content as long as you have both a human and a Shi there. Your
# space force is free to go where it needs to be, but parking it above
# Ganymede would be preferable. With the Quarrels blasting enemy ships out
# of the skies with their LongBows, you should be all set.
# Groundwise, you have at your disposal a host of powerful Shi and Earther
# troops equipped with the latest in weapons technology. When you bring units
# like Ordnance Master, Haliesh-Damir, and some of the interrupts like Easy
# Prey and Armor Penetrating to bear, enemy troops will be quickly decimated
# by your legions.
