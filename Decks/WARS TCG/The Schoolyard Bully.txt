# If you are like me ever since you fist heard about these hulking aliens you
# have been anxiously awaiting their arrival. These seven feet tall aliens with
# razor sharp claws, shredding teeth, and a frenzied bloodlust, are wicked
# cool. You were probably also disappointed when you cracked open your fist
# pack and found these weak power one or two wimps in place of the
# powerhouse monsters you were expecting. At first glace the Quay are about
# as tough as those geeky kids with glasses in elementary school that always
# got their lunch money stolen (I learned to hide my lunch money in my sock.)
# After mourning for a few weeks I came back and took another look at these
# ultra cool extra terrestrials and found that they are not as weak as they would
# seem. In fact with the right combination of cards they can be downright
# devastating. Let's take a look at a few card combos that will turn the Quay
# into the schoolyard bully.
# Kayaldi/Tunnels
# This is one of my favourite combinations in the game; you have Kayaldi, a
# zero power Quay with a neat ability to assassinate characters when she
# moves (provided you have 2 units on your lost pile a feat easily
# accomplished by Talkan, Kulak, or Sitka). Not a powerhouse in any means
# as killing a character in the move phase is good but not game changing.
# Now lets take Kayaldi and combine her with a Quay order called Tunnels,
# this card lets you move people around in the deploy phase making Kayaldi a
# monster in her own right. Now you can deploy Kayaldi use Tunnels to move
# her to an enemy held site and knock off one of their big guns there, Torako,
# Howler, or even Wilgress, you have to use the timing system to your
# advantage and use Kulak's ability after drawing your destiny for Tunnels to
# insure you get two units on top of your used pile. Having eliminated a key
# part of their force there you can proceed with your deploy phase and drop
# your Quay down at that site to ravage those units who thought they were
# safe under the wing of Jack Wilgress. Kayaldi is good but she can only get
# rid of characters, what if it's a nasty vehicle or No-Bot that is giving you
# grief? Well then you can use Tunnels with a few other cards to take care of
# those problems. Hounded lets you destroy any unit with less power than one
# of your Quay when it moves to a site, so move one of your big boys over and
# destroy that vehicle that is giving you problems. Cloak of Fear will send a
# unit with less tactics (than the kizen it is on) back to the owners hand, with
# this asset Kulak and Sitka can send home those No-Bots who only have
# three tactics, granted they can be re-deployed next turn but having them
# gone one turn should let you put the beats on your opponent.
# Chuluktika/Occupied Tunnels
# This is another nasty combo that can lead to some serious beats on your
# opponent. Set up a stronghold of Quay at the Ganymede/Occupied Tunnels
# and then use Chuluktika to move one of your opponent's vehicles there,
# before the battle phase, where it will be powerless (literally) and you can
# crush it with your large force of waiting Quay. The one problem that might
# occur in this process is that the opponent might bring some units along for
# the ride in his vehicle to even the odds. That might make it closer to a fair
# fight and if its one thing you don't want to do that is fight fair. To help prevent
# this we can add another card to this combo to tip the scales more in your
# favour. Katal life ship has the ability to put units back into the opponent's
# hand but it has to be deployed to an empty sector. To insure you will get
# your devastating combo off just hold a copy of the Ganymede/Traginium
# Source, Chuluktika, and the Katal Life Ship in your hand until you are ready
# to work your magic and then deploy the Katal Life Ship to the empty
# Traginium Source you just played to send a unit back to the opponents hand
# before dropping Chuluktika and moving your hapless victim over to be
# crushed.
# Luhustika/Alnak
# While our other two combos dealt with destroying your opponent in combat
# now we will turn our attention to the other important arena in WARS and that
# is draining. Quay may not seem to be very strong in this arena compared to
# the powerhouse that is the Maverick draining deck, but with just two cards
# the Quay have the potential to exceed the Mavs in draining damage.
# # Luhustika and Alnak both add one to any drains at sites related to them,
# Luhustika must be in space and Alnak must be on the ground. Let's take a
# look at just how big we can get our drain with these two on the table.
# Realistically you should be able to hold three sites on Ganymede, if you have
# already smashed your opponent with one of the above combo's then maybe
# four sites. If you control three sites that you can drain your opponent for two
# at, then with the plus one that Alnak will give to two of those site (she is does
# not add to the drain at the location she is at) then you are draining for eight a
# turn. If you have Luhustika at Ganymede/Traginium Source then all those
# sites are plus one for drains and your drain jumps to eleven a turn. If you
# also can keep control of Ganymede/Traginium Source than you will have an
# extra drain of four (one for Traginium Source plus one for every site you
# control) taking our total to a whopping fifteen. I don't know about you but if I
# was getting drained for fifteen a turn that would be enough to have me crying
# like a little schoolgirl.
# Now that we have some brutal combos lets see if we can throw them
# together into one butt-kicking monstrosity of a deck.

# Start the game with Alnak Station/Captured Base so you can get your three
# Quay support icons quickly. Then build up a hand and get set up for one of
# the beat down combos we talked about so that when your opponent deploys
# some units you can let him have it. Continue to pound him into the ground
# until he has no will to live then proceed to drain him to death using the
# draining method we talked about. Now you can go out with this deck and
# push all the weaker decks around and be happy your lunch money will never
# be taken again.
