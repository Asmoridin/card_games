# With the new set out, I believe that space decks are going to take a great hit.
# I do not believe that they are going to be played as much as they were before
# this sets release, but on the other hand I do think that they you will still find
# some well built versions that still will compete. The new space encampments
# are probably the best cards to come out from this set. They allow a player to
# have a little protection from losing their icons to overburdened and they allow
# nice late game space drains.
# I have determined that when building a well-balanced deck including both
# sufficient ground and space packages it would require;

# UNITS
3 Kulak
3 Jack Wilgress

2 Killer Cait Grimalkin
2 "Two-Way" Berson
2 Cartel Legate
# SHIPS
2 Karaktika
2 Cat's Claw
3 Death Dealer
3 Tahka Life Ship
# INTERRUPTS
2 Overburdened
4 Trumped
4 Waylaid
2 Life Leech
1 Breaching
4 Expansion
# LOCATIONS
2 Jupiter/Approach Route
2 Belt/Derelict Freighter
1 Ganymede/Core Shaft

1 Themis/Landing Pad (starting)

# The deck here has a kizen ground fighting squad with a strong killing
# machine for space. On the ground this deck has all of your favorite main
# guys from the first set. Starting off our line up with your leader of the group
# Jack Wilgress, and with his second in command Kulak. Now Kulak is not just
# a pretty face, he is also great for helping you out in a bind when your
# opponent plays overburdened.
# Now this deck has had the honor of being able to add a few new members to
# their team. Banak Ilnasit is a man that you do not want to lose a fight around,
# with his ability to undamage himself to damage another unit with him. He is a
# great force to have from this new set out. He helps to get ride of that peskey
# character in front of him with that weapon or just annoying you. Joker
# Danniko is one of the best new charters to have a weapon with, this deck
# does not use her for the weapon aspect, it uses her because she has great
# stats for being so cheep, along with being a kizen. This deck also has its
# ground tech. Trumps for control and Waylads for making your opponent think
# twice about going to the ground. Also this deck plays a lot of Kizens, so being
# able to use it will not be a problem. Life Leech is one of the most under
# looked cards of this set. This card allows you to damage one of your
# opponents units while saving one of yours. Not to bad.
# Now for draining your opponent, Cartel Legate and Two Way are always
# there for you, but they have found a new friend. Aris Thantos is not really a
# draining guy, but when you do drain he allows more cards to be lost along
# with the ability to see what densities are coming up for your opponent.
# For the skies in this deck it has much to offer. Tahka Life Ship for strength
# with cheapness. Death Dealer is great for damaging a specific ship in space
# with the new encampments by your side. They allow them to invert and do
# their thing. For controlling what ships they keep in play, Karaktika is great for
# a late game killing spree. For the cream of the crop, the ship with the most,
# you got Cat's Claw. This ship had power and immunity. With Killer Cait
# Grimalkin on that ship, your opponent is going to need a nice fleet to knock
# her out. So with this deck do not fear going in to space and showing them
# how to fly.
# In all, this deck is the best all-round deck you can get. Forces on the ground
# are not to be messed with, and the space fleet is one that no man wants to
# face. So when times get tough and you not sure what to do with this deck,
# just remember that fighting is not your last option, it's the only one! If your
# going to do it, make sure you do it right.
