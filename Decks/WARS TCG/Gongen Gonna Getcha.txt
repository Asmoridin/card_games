# The Gongen may not be the most straight forward faction to play. They don't
# have access to the raw power the Earthers and Shi possess. They don't
# have the dirty tricks of the Mavericks. They don't have the never ending
# swarm ability of the Quay. What they do have though is grit, determination,
# and the somewhat annoying ability to turn the most overwhelming of odds.
# Most of their units are fairly cheap, versatile, and have high defense values,
# which is helped by many other cards. Gongen are perhaps the most effective
# at both activating extra energy and at retrieving lost cards. They are team
# players more then other faction, becoming more powerful in groups then the
# sum of their parts. As a general rule, the Gongen have the ability to outlast
# their opponents and win by pounding them into submission.
# How to Play The Gongen
# First lets look at how the Gongen work on the ground. At first, you might think
# that the Gongen are rather weak on the ground. It may be true that the
# Gongen's ground game may not be as good as they are in space, but they
# are still quite a force planet side. Most Gongen units are cheap, almost all
# costing 3 or fewer energy to play. This allows a player to place a large
# number of units in one place to absorb damage as needed. They tend to
# have high defense values for their costs allowing them to absorb more
# damage then their counterparts from other factions. Kano Masako is a good
# example of this more defensive nature, and taking it one step further. This
# defensive ability is augmented by several support cards ranging from
# weapons like Gongen Katana to support cards that further provide defenses.
# Gongen ground units also have the ability to lower the defenses of their
# opponents, allowing their less powerful ground based weapons to still cause
# major damage as well as damaging or destroying units outright. The last
# thing the Gongen do well on the ground (as well as in space to a lesser
# degree) is produce extra energy at multiple points during the turn. Thus a
# Gongen deck always seems to have all the energy it needs. Oh, almost
# forgot, the NoBots. Yeah, these guys are just huge in every way and provide
# that extra firepower boost you often need on the ground with the Gongen.
# While they should not be left to their own devices, they are the most
# frightening force on the ground when they are with friends.
# In space, the Gongen seem to excel and are arguably the dominant force
# there in the current play environment. This is true despite the lack of any
# characters in the Gongen faction with piloting. However, with the ships the
# Gongen have, who the heck needs pilots. Gongen space power is based
# upon one basic concept, strength in numbers. On their own, Gongen ships
# are just average. Some are even greatly overcosted at first glance. However,
# in numbers (particularly in groups of three or more) they become downright
# nasty. Following the theme of the ground units, Gongen space units are
# cheap for what they do, particularly the fighters, which helps you get more of
# these guys out. The Gongen are also the only faction that possesses ships
# with Transport which is a big help in moving the large clouds of fighters
# around the solar system. Ships like Zocho and its fighters as well as support
# cards like Cloud demonstrate just how deadly the Tenno is en masse.
# Gongen support cards complement the abilities of the units well in addition to
# providing some additional abilities. A number of them are devoted to bringing
# cards out of the lost pile or at least provide some additional use to cards that
# are being lost. Others compliment the weapons of the Gongen, making them
# even more effective and damaging to your opponents. They also provide
# assitance in obtaining more energy to fuel your devious plans.
# When its all said in done, the Gongen simply don't go down without a fight.
# They've learned to do more with less and thus are a powerful threat in the
# WARS to come. And mark my word, the "Reds" get even nastier in Nowhere
# to Hide.
# Let the WARS continue!

# Strategy
# With this deck, the objective is simple. In space, spread out and drain like
# crazy, using the raw power of the Tenno to swat any opposition out of the
# way. As I stated above, you should try and keep at least three of your ships
# together to get power bonuses from your ships and other things. The
# locations here are designed to get you maximum drain mileage as well as
# many places to use Amorian Shipyard (hence why Vesta is in there). On the
# ground, the best thing to do would be to try and hold down one or two sites,
# the Bunker being the obvious candidate for this using the NoBots and the
# supporting cards.
