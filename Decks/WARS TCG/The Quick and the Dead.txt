# "That was fast...‚Äù
# The last words of the Kid, after getting gunned down by his dad, take on new
# meaning in January, as the WARS world will be changed by the new
# quickdraw skill in Nowhere to Hide.
# Characters with this skill can fire their weapons multiple times in battle and
# will make weapon cards more potent and devastating. Weapons already had
# a decent array of support cards to use with them; quickdraw is just the icing
# on the cake.
# Each faction in Nowhere to Hide will have characters with this skill,
# characters ranging from the godly Joker Danniko to the average Careless
# Cat. If you were reluctant to include weapons in your decks before quickdraw
# # should provide that incentive. One can only guess at the impact that this skill
# will have on the game, as far as meta changes I would imagine you would
# see more of cards like Easy Prey and Collaborative Strike and other cards
# that play with defence to account for the increase of weapons that decks will
# likely see.
# Cards that recover damaged characters like First Aid and Armored will likely
# also see increased table time as holding down sites will become tougher with
# characters flying off the table left and right. To be honest it is tough to gauge
# the effects a skill like quickdraw will have on the game, but I know it will be a
# welcome addition to many people arsenals.
# # There is not much else I can say about the new skill so lets just leave it at
# that and get on to the only part anyone ever reads anyway and that is the
# deck. As I was looking at the quickdraw characters I kept coming back to
# Joker Danniko but I think it is clear how good she is so I decided to base the
# deck around the Quay and Earther, but using Gongen weapons.

# This deck is designed to win battles on the ground pure and simple. The
# ships are included mostly to get your SI out fast and in a pinch the Sitkatika
# Hekatons can be used to take out fighters in space that are hurting you with
# drains. Pompeii with a few fighters can guard your Alnak Station to prevent
# getting drained there and should be fairly safe.
# With the array of characters you have there is plenty of quickdraw to go
# around. Mouthpiece can get your weapons out and in play faster, Coreg and
# the Coordinators are there for destiny control in order to make sure your
# weapons are hitting. Alnak is included in case you get into a drain race you
# can use all your encampments as Ganymede sites and spread out and drain
# that way. With this deck I would unload all your weapons at the start of the
# battle for two reasons, firstly the over flow attrition will boost your rangers
# strength, and also with Katuka prowling around your opponent will have a
# tough time drawing destiny. Waylaid will work with Kulak, the Coordinators or
# even Coreg to make sure your opponent is not getting a destiny because you
# will need to keep your characters around. If your opponent is packing
# weapons as well use Collaborative Strike to in sure you characters do not get
# hit. If you do happen to lose characters relocate them to the Hallway where
# the Transport Depot will be to get the back into the fray on Ganymede.
# It may seem extreme to include Gongen SI only for their weapons but with
# quickdraw u will be spending a lot of energy firing them and the low cost to
# fire the Gongen weapons works great. The Thunder-Edge Greatsword can
# be used to take down the tougher characters and the Plasma Cannon is all
# around great. The Gongen Katana is wonderful because it can be cycled
# back into your hand rather than lost to make sure your characters always
# have weapons on them.
# Interrupts are a key part to any deck and the choice here is not taken lightly.
# Armor Penetrating is an obvious choice with all the weapons and quickdraw
# we have, Collaborative Strike is also good in a weapon deck. Tunnels is
# great for hitting your unsuspecting opponent hard, and Hostilities Unleashed
# is in there in the case that the opponent makes the mistake of leaving a lone
# or a few lone characters at a site after a battle, then you can take advantage
# and deliver a devastating blow.
# Quickdraw is a skill not to be underestimated, and all those of you with an
# itchy trigger out there are going to love playing with it. Remember, in the
# dangerous regions of space you better be quick or you will wind up dead.
