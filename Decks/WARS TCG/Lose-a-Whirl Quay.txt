# I tried to make a deck that had cards from more than one culture in it this
# time. Change is good, but then I looked through the Quay cards from
# Nowhere to Hide and knew I couldn't venture into dual-faction territory right
# now. Spineslinger, Suppressed, and some new locations really jumped out at
# me, and combining them with Revenge from Incursion just makes sense. The
# new Traginium asset mechanic seemed neat, too, so I decided to stick with
# an all-Quay deck.
# This deck is straightforward, and would do well in a beginner's hands. The
# basic idea behind this deck is to make your opponent lose cards quicker than
# you do. Since that's the whole point to WARS, I figured it was a solid
# strategy.
# About some specific card choices: Revenge has always been a good card
# (and for card efficiency it is hard to beat: lose one to make your opponent
# lose two), and should be in any Quay drain deck. Spineslinger is deadly
# when he wipes out a site by himself during your control phase, which then
# helps you to drain there and makes Suppressed that much easier to pull off.
# The new Quay location Ganymede/Captured Refinery is perfect for this deck,
# since we can pack the Refinery with inverted units and make our opponent
# lose one energy for each of them. This is where the Spineslinger should be
# spending most of his time. The new sector encampments are beneficial to
# this deck since they can be used as a sector location if need be, or placed on
# a site just like Incursion's encampments.
# Use The Beckoning to get inverters into play quickly, and put them at the
# Refinery. If you can't invert them using their game text, then use the new
# destiny-6 interrupt Attack Plan. Traginium Hoard and Prolonged Exposure
# are ways to increase your opponent's card loss, as planned. There's nothing
# to tricky involved here, just drain possibilities and ways to make your
# opponent lose energy. Your forces are not too weak; so a few battles should
# be winnable. If Spineslinger clears out the refinery (when it's packed with four
# or five of your inverters) enough times during the game, the energy loss
# should do plenty damage to your opponent's energy supply, giving you the
# win.
