# “Infantry soldiers have little choice but to trust the experience of their
# commanders. Earther troops are among the most battle-tested of the human
# factions.”
# What a beautiful flavor text to lead into this article. The Earther warrior is a
# soldier, his mission is to go in and destroy the enemy, site control is
# important, but not as important as eliminating the enemy's stronghold. The
# Earther warrior can drop down to a site and with tactics less than 4 they can
# still do a lot of damage, and I am here to explain how. From my experience in
# game play over the past 2 weeks I have realized that building up an army of
# Earther warriors not only gives away the element of surprise, but allows your
# opponent to play an equal amount of units who each have twice as much, if
# not 3 times as much, strength as your warriors. This had become a problem
# for me so I decided to go back to the drafting board and devise a battle plan
# for the warriors assigned to protect Earth.
# The Earthers are not particularly strong when they are by themselves,
# considering how most characters and vehicles (as well as ships) cannot draw
# a destiny when they are alone, so they must work around this problem. The
# other thing working against Earthers is the high cost for what could be
# considered weak stats. However, once you can bypass the cost, the Earther
# warriors and vehicles can be devastating.

# When I had noticed Fighter Support, it unleased a river of potential. It was
# this card that allowed for any unit in a site battle at a related site to add (D) to
# their battle destiny. This is a huge factor in battles, not only does adding (D)
# to destiny increase your strength and the attrition you cause to your
# opponent, but if you have a single card at the site you have less worry about
# meeting that 4 tactics to draw destiny.
# Now let me discuss this single unit feature that the Earthers can get away
# with that other factions may not necessarily be able to deal with. One issue
# that the Earthers have is that in order to play the stronger vehicles such as
# Heavy Juggernaut or Howler's Blades you must dismiss a unit. This may
# cause several problems, in that you may have no other units at the site to
# add to these vehicles' 2 tactics, or to use as attrition fodder. So you may not
# necessarily choose to deploy these units right away, allowing your opponent
# to drain you for 1-3 energy. Now with Fighter Support, you can draw that
# destiny with only 2 tactics, and the best part about Fighter support is that it's
# a non-unique asset. If you have 2 or more out at related sites, you get to add
# (D) to your destiny 2 or more extra times, so the thought of 3 destiny may
# make your opponent question battling your one unit.
# Now I know the next question, what about the one unit? Won't it have to be
# sacrificed because of attrition? No, this is also where the Earthers succeed
# where others fail. Just because you have 1 unit doesn't mean it will become
# lost. First Aid is an asset that helps prevent units from becoming destroyed.
# Basically this allows your unit, which is not just characters but vehicles as
# well, to be assigned the attrition and soak up any damage, but instead of
# sending it off to the lost pile, if you can pay the 4 energy, the unit shall remain
# at the site and become undamaged. This will help to keep those large
# vehicles which you had to dismiss units to play out at the site.
# Now of course your opponent will realize sooner or later that Fighter Support
# is a main threat and will try to eliminate the characters at the site in order to
# dismiss the asset. As a small safeguard against your opponent dropping
# several units to the site all at once, you protect those sites with Entrenched
# Infantry. The downside to these warriors is that for you to drain at this site, or
# to deploy a character to this site, you must lose 2 energy. The plus side to
# these warriors is that for your opponent to deploy to the same site it will force
# them to lose 2 energy a unit. This is a small road block, as your opponent will
# deploy to an adjacent site and then move, however they will not be allowed
# to battle immediately, and therefore give you one turn to protect your warrior.
# Also, the Entrenched Infantry is 3 power, 5 tactics, and 6 defense! He can
# draw a destiny by himself and then take advantage of Fighter Support. Throw
# several other warriors at his site, such as Grav Operator or Infantry Officer
# and your units begin to jump high up in strength. So how do all of these thinly
# spread units who draw a potential 4-5 destiny really work out? They work out
# pretty well, but there is no space so anti-drain cards such as CISyn
# Retaliation are needed. Also, because of the element of surprise attacks that
# 1 or 2 warriors may have, since they can draw 3-4 destiny causing a ton of
# attrition, this usually empties your opponent's side down to 1 or 2 units. This
# is when they no longer have enough tactics to draw battle destiny, and thank
# the good maker that they can slam you next turn…however, they won't be
# that lucky. Hostilities Unleashed is a lost interrupt that can begin a new battle
# at a site you already initiated one this turn! What a great way to use your 3-4
# battle destiny to slam it hard to your opponent's lone unit!
