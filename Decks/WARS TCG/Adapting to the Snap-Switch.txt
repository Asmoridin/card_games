# For those of you that did not make it out to the Vegas Open, it was a great
# weekend. Lots of prizes and lots of fun were had by all that attended. I also
# learned a lot in my few days in Sin City, after spending close to 30 hrs
# drafting over two days there I think I have learned how to draft much better
# than I did before...I hope so at least. I mean really, 30 hrs spent doing
# anything should make you a master at it, except knitting, knitting is tricky
# stuff. The other thing that I learned on the weekend was the fact that nearly
# everyone was talking about the Snap Switch deck. Most were commenting
# that Shift in Tactics should be changed, and many wanted to ban Rousing
# Leap. In either case much of the talk of the weekend revolved around this
# deck. There was a few people playing it in the constructed tournaments that
# were run and you can believe that it will rear its head at most major events
# this summer. In order to prepare for this most of my constructed decks will
# probably run a few cards dedicated to taking down this monster but not too
# many that it will take away from the deck strategy itself.
# For those of you out there that may not be aware of the Snap Switch deck, it
# revolves around drawing a monster hand with Begging for Mercy, then
# dropping a lone Kizen with a weapon to fight, pumping up the defense of said
# Kizen via Collaborative strike or Anticipation, taking them all back into hand
# with Rousing Leap and repeating until their defense is very large, then Snap
# Switch their defense and tactics and playing Shift in Tactics to make their
# battle destiny whatever their defense was, usually in the area of about 70
# giving them a power of 100+ and ending the game. Cards that can hurt this
# deck are Easy Prey, which gives them no battle destiny, however they still
# get their power (which is usually around 30), so that is not the greatest.
# There is Do Not Push that makes all their interrupts cost 3 more energy, but
# that card is discarded after one turn so even if you have all four in hand your
# opponent will just wait until that card is not on the table. Overburdened is
# one of the best defenses against this deck, and a few Overburdened (lost)
# can shut this beast down. Still, you know your opponent will have Trumped
# for protection so you will need a handful of Trumped yourself in order to win
# that war. Most decks use at least a few copies of Overburdened and always
# four Trumped anyhow, so it is easy to use those as defenses against the
# Snap Switch deck, however there is one other card that splashes into most
# decks and can make a world of difference - Faded.
# Playing Faded on the opponents lone Kizen means they cannot target him
# with any cards and leave him helpless. In order to make this work you have
# to use the timing system to your advantage. When you see them play their
# Kizen down you know the fight is coming; hopefully you have a decent hand
# with some Trumped and Overburdened and at least one Faded. Play the
# Overburdened as soon as they deploy their Kizen and let them trump them,
# you don't want to get into a Trump war until you are sure that you can win.
# Once they initiate the battle play Faded as a reaction to that while the battle
# is pending. This way they cannot play any of their interrupts that play during
# a battle because it is still pending and not actually in a battle phase yet.
# They will try and Trump it, but because you baited some of their trumped with
# Overburdened you should be able to win the trump war and then the battle
# will proceed and you can trounce the lone Kizen that they deployed. If you
# don't manage to get the right cards that you need in hand Premeditated
# Reaction is a great card for protecting against the combo as well.
# To a deck that I had built previously, I just added a few Faded and the
# Premeditated Reaction and that was really all I needed to change. This is a
# space-oriented deck focusing on keeping ships on the table with immunity to
# attrition and using Protective Fire to give immunity to the ships that don't
# have it. Price of the Game is included to lower the destiny of the opponent,
# either to make sure their Racing Sloops don't invert or to make sure they
# have no attrition when they are fighting against Dhanake. Cerebral Incursion
# also helps in space to make sure you are not losing ships to attrition.
