# Up until now the Earther faction as a whole could be considered slightly
# weaker than the rest. Cost for cost, the Earthers seemed to be unbalanced
# in the direction TCG players do not favor, this is seen most often with cards
# like Heavy Juggernaut which seem to cost only 3 to play until you read the
# “Dismiss a Unit Here” text, which means you must have another unit out in
# play before Heavy Juggernaut, and is slighty less useful than other cards
# costing 3-4 which also have an ability of 4. Essentially, for Earthers to get
# rolling you would have needed a very good opening hand, including a
# Transport Depot To get your little warriors off of Planet Earth.
# That was of course, until now. As many of you have seen Nowhere to Hide
# offers a whole new definition to the Earther Faction and to what they can
# accomplish. First and foremost, they have the makings of a truly
# unstoppable space fleet with cards like Rogan Hallard and his ship
# Shadowsurfer This more than makes up for the Earther Pilots from Incursion
# who only had Piloting 1. And of course there is the XeRacer. Which brings
# back to mind the fun days of reacts. However the space fleet is not the most
# exciting thing to come to the Earther Faction. To me, the exciting cards are
# all the new Kizen.

# Basically The idea of this deck is to keep one or two Locations securely
# locked down with your space fleet, while sending your kizen around to varied
# sites to deal damage to an unexpecting opponent. The way this should work
# to your benefit is through the Kizen. They have the unique ability to change
# your destiny, as well as fortell the future draws. This is where cards like
# CISyn Coordinators becomes very useful. For the simple cost of 1 energy,
# you can look at the top card of any reserve. Now although this ability is
# unique, the character is not, and therefore you can easily look at both
# reserves if you have enough units and energy and you can easily know
# whether or not you should run the other direction. That is of course unless
# you have Sheria Coreg out in play. She can easily get rid of your opponents
# 6 destiny or your 0 and place it on the bottom of your reserve for 1 energy.
# Is there a large annoyance that your opponent has out at a crucial site, well
# then Jylan Rathe is your man. Combine him with any other unit at that site
# battle and you can damage an opponents unit, then before you lose any
# characters from the battle, simply use Patch Job and keep your Kizen around
# to fight another battle.
# In Nowhere to Hide, it is all about manipulating the table for the Earthers.
