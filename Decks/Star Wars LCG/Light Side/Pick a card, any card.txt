Hand disruption

Smugglers and Spies


Objective (10)

    1x Matter Under Mind (The Forest Moon 196-1)
    2x Spark of Rebellion (Galactic Ambitions 229-1)
    2x Spirit of Rebellion (Allies of Necessity 262-1)
    2x Stand Together (Power of the Force 251-1)
    2x The Last Warrior (A Wretched Hive 237-1)
    1x Tiny Robotic Sociopath (Technological Terror 257-1)



Chip away at your opponents hand by combos such as The Last Warrior/Embers of hope + Sabacc Shift. Spirit of Rebellion + Spark would also make opponent discard. You see what I'm trying to do here.. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I love dicard decks and want to build a competitive version
