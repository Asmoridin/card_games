My newest version of my Jedi deck.  I've tried to look at what people are doing since the new sets have come out.  It was pretty tough for me to take out my last Journey in the Swamp, but I think in the current climate that Mysteries of the Rim is a better choice.  Also switched from BtS to Core Luke after peeking at decisions made during Worlds.  It makes the deck just a little more aggressive than it was, which feels okay.  Also, I've been very happy with The Survivors as a one-of since I started playing the game again.  It is both a main set and a support set, and I think the deck would do well to have two instead of just one.

I've always found 2x Survivors to be about all the protection Jedi decks need, making Secrets of Yavin 4 redundant. You may want to look at other mains to give the deck some extra punch. 

 

Some suggestions:

-Flight of the Crow --> Colonists are meh, but Crow and event are huge against Navy with their swarms, shields and healing effects.

-Forgotten Masters --> 3 units with blast, one being a very strong main. Event and Echoes can allow for some silly turns with MTFBWY.

-Journey to Dagobah --> has seen a surge in popularity thanks to the economic and blast boost it provides.

-Gamor Run --> you wouldn't be playing mono but it's still crazy strong in Jedi.

-Asteroid Sanctuary --> Good ol' Falcon and other tools for multi-striking. You'd also keep a Twist.
