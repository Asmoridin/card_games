// Creatures make holes. Vehicles drop bombs. 

// Obviously Jubba birds and spiders can make windows for your vehicles to get through. Yoda and his hut keep the force while sending in the vehicles.
// The plethora of events and high resource count make this deck hard to anticipate. Now for the details. 

// Master's Domain, Secret of Shantipole and Journey to Dagobah all offer great resources, but I often will use Journey through the Swamp for even more resource ramp
// by putting in the Tauntan for free. I usually mulligan any hand that does not have a lot I can deploy for a very fast first turn. Average card cost is exceptionally
// low, so rushing your opponent is the norm.

// Using the creatures, events and Yoda's tactics, shut down or lock down the enemy so that Red 5, Crow, Blue 9 and the speeders get through.
// Then, use Size matters Not to double strike with the big guns. 

// Remember to use you events regularly, pacing them when you have Luke's Landspeeder out. I want to do a direct objective damage once each turn 
// (keeping force means 3 damage per round). Think about the best way to use your creatures. Jubba Birds can give you great edge. After the edge battle play
// Life Creates it to put all your creatures back into play, sac a Jubba bird and shut down one of your opposing units' guns or tactics. There are many resourceful
// combos in this deck.
