2 Wookiee Life Debt


// Wookie Life Debt is absolute key. You want to get out a few Wookies (especially Chewbacca of course) and have them protect each other and your other main 
// characters (Han, Lando). The Falcon objective set is there for the Falcon (with so many characters - why not?) and for some extra tricksery.
