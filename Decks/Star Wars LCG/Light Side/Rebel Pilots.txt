Rebel Alliance



Objective (10)

    2x Called to Arms (Draw Their Fire 147-1)
    2x Heroes of the Rebellion (Jump to Lightspeed 167-1)
    2x Hoth Operations (The Desolation of Hoth 38-1)
    2x Rogue Squadron Assault (Ready for Takeoff 141-1)
    2x Running the Trench (Attack Run 157-1)

Reasoning to exclude Defense of Yavin 4?

I'd personally drop one Running the Trench and one Heroes of the Rebellion for 2x Defense. Moar Rebel Assaults.
