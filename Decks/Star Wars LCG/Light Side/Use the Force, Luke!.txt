"You haven't lived until you flopped Palpatine to blow up an objective with Pilot Luke" Jarrat

Rebel Alliance
Two-resource Rebel/Smugglers affiliation card

Objective (10)

    2x Evacuation Procedure (Escape from Hoth 65-1)
    2x Resistance and Rebellion (Meditation and Mastery 243-1)
    2x Rogue Squadron Assault (Ready for Takeoff 141-1)
    1x Running the Trench (Attack Run 157-1)
    1x Secret Weapons (New Alliances 191-1)
    2x The Daring Escape (Draw Their Fire 148-1)

Find and use Luke on Stolen AT-ST or Outrider to try one-shot an enemy objective even despite of a wall of defenders. (Stolen AT-ST often is unfocusable and undamageable and Outrider can suddenly join an engagement when defenders are exhausted).

2x Han Solo (to find Luke), 6 Stay on Targets and some shields around (Loyal Co-Pilot, Luke's enhancement, Toryn Farr, Hiding Among Enemies) to help you perform the "trench" strike. 

Also several pilots on Red Squadron X-Wing (potentially 4 - with Nien Numb and Loyal Co-Pilots on the board) - that's funny. Discarding Luke from this ship can really allow you to use his ability several times per turn (i did it, but tbh unfortunately only to get one additional damage for two strikes).

There is no Twist of Fate, but a lot of black icons. Moreover, 10 three-pip cards, Tydirium, YT-2000 Freighter, Rogue Squadron Assault's card draw effect and Hiding Among Enemies make it possible to win the edge sometimes (and use "every time surprised" I Have You Now) as well.

For good setup turns there are 8 non-limit resource enhancements along with two-resource affiliation card,  3 two-resource objectives and many (actually most of the units) 2-3 cost guys and ships (5 with three pips to take the Force back on turn two and keep the Force later).

The truth though - most times Luke does 0-2 damages, so the deck is great only in order to "flop Palpatine to blow up an objective with pilot Luke", just for fun. It doesn't contain any board removals (events, targeted strike), so the opponent builds the board and you loose.
