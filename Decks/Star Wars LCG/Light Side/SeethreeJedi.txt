Casual
The newest incarnation of my Jedi deck.  Had this for a while but wanted to see what people thought.

Jedi


Objective (10)

    2x A Hero’s Beginning (Chain of Command 161-1)
    2x A Hero’s Trial (Between the Shadows 127-1)
    2x May the Force Be With You (Join Us or Die 112-1)
    1x Mysteries of the Rim (Imperial Entanglements 176-1)
    2x The Survivors (Draw Their Fire 146-1)
    1x Watchers in the Wasteland (Balance of the Force 91-1)

I think Rio won a regional using this deck only he swapped out Rim for Crow. I was gonna test it out but never got around to it. Looks solid!
