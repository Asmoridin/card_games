Wanna combo with the lovers


Objective (12)

    2x Hope of Rebellion (Galactic Ambitions 224-1)
    2x Mission to Talay (Galactic Ambitions 226-1)
    2x Pushing Back the Empire (Allies of Necessity 261-1)
    2x Questionable Contacts (Core 15-1)
    2x Spirit of Rebellion (Allies of Necessity 262-1)
    2x Trust Me (Edge of Darkness 71-1)

Using Mercinery Contacts S&amp;S affiliation, possible switch to Information Network later if 7 cards is too fast.

Best starting flop would be Spirit of Rebellion, Pushing Back the Empire and either Hope of Rebellion or Mission to Talay. 

Obvious combo is obvious with Jyn/Cassie. Jyn/Kyle Could be good as well as Han/Casssie.
