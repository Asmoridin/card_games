Rebel Alliance


Objective (12)

    2x A Legend Begins (Meditation and Mastery 242-1)
    1x Alderaan's Promise (Edge of Darkness 77-1)
    1x Evacuation Procedure (Escape from Hoth 65-1)
    2x Fleeing the Empire (Core 10-1)
    2x Haunting the Empire (Power of the Force 252-1)
    2x Rogue Squadron Assault (Ready for Takeoff 141-1)
    2x Theyâ€™ll Never Stop Us (Swayed by the Dark Side 276-1)

I can NEVER get fighter decks to work.  Ever.  I always feel you need to have the right combination of cards on the table (matching pilots and enhancements) and it I just can't seem to make it come together.  However, I am still determined to experiment.

First the obvious: 12 objectives.
The pip count right now is 96, which is good.  However, if I take out some obvious pods the pip count goes way down.
Take out 1 Haunting: the count goes down to 88 (and I lose a resource)
Take out Alderaan's Promise: the count goes down 86, which is bad.
Take out 1 Leia: the count doesn't suffer too much, but I lose half of her mechanic, and a Twist.
Maybe take out a Biggs?

Why Leia?
I like the idea of flooding the board and potentially freeing up all the units to strike again.  This is the reason Han is in here.  He can be sacrificed to grab Leia.  Plus, the objective adds 9 pips and has a zero cost resource.

Why on Earth is Alderaan's Promise even in here?
Something different.  Plus, it has 10 pips, gives me a better chance to hold the Force, a resource, the ability to search for a unique unit, and to redirect engagements and damage to an objective.
