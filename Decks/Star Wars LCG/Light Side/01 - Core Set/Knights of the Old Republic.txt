Consider replacing one of the Outcast or Obi pods with the Obi from Between the Shadows, which includes a resource, an event that can focus down any unit, and a main who can wreck multifaction decks if you have Force Users (you do). You might also think about adding The Survivors. I don't know much about the Star Wars universe beyond what's in the original trilogy, but I suspect Rahn would be a great fit for the theme. His pod also comes with Force Rejuvination, which is extremely powerful.
