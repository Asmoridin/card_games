// x1 K-2SO replaces x1 Snowspeeder from A Hero's Resolve (64-3). 

// A couple notable plays the deck can make are looping Snowspeeder Counterattack with Balance of the Force Obi-Wan and putting force cleansing on Major Bren Derlin to attack and defend with edge 2/3 (provided he's not committed to the force). If you can get the objective draw of: The Hoth Gambit, Inhospitable Deployments, and A Hero's Resolve, then you have force strength, resource discounts, and very high edge. If you can start with three Hoth objectives, which odds are most times you will, Subzero Defenses is a supremely strong card.
