Just playing around with my cardpool and some of the new faction cards.  Figured I'd do a revamp of Hoth speeders.  There's probably a better build for this, but my cardpool is limited so this is what I came up with.

Rebel Alliance




2 A Hero's Resolve
1 A Legend Begins (Meditation and Mastery 242-1)
2 Attack Pattern Delta
2 Hoth Operations (The Desolation of Hoth 38-1)
2 Running the Canyon (Technological Terror 256-1)
1 The Secret at Shantipole (Attack Run 156-1)
