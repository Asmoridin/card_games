TWO TWISTS OF FATE?

Planning the Attack can be switched out with Mission to Talay or another Commando Operations at your preference. I believe Planning meshes the best though, especially since there's a bunch of leaders to buff the Rebel Tacticians. 

If you plan to edit the deck though, try to keep at least 7/10 Endor objectives. Battle of Endor is your bread and butter, and you want to guarantee that at least 2/3 of your objectives in play have an Endor trait.
