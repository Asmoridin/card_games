2 A Hero's Resolve
2 Asteroid Sanctuary (Edge of Darkness 72-1)
2 Last Defense of Hoth
2 Memories of Taanab (Ready for Takeoff 142-1)
2 The Daring Escape (Draw Their Fire 148-1)


Personal Hope was to get Last Defense of Hoth, A Hero's Resolve and 1 other objective at the start, hoping to play System Patrol Craft to keep Last Defense active. Not much to it other then that, thinking of dropping Hero's Resolve just dont know what for, its largely just there for its good edge winning capabilities.
