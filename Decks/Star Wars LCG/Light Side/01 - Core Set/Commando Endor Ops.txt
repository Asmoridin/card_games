Cracken rescue shenanigans boosted by Feigning captivity. Most mains have tactics allowing to better control defenders, a bit of fate cards manipulation to make edge battles a dangerous place for your opponent.

Killer setup is done with Feigning Captivity on the board with Cracken out, allowing you to stack objectives with captured cards and extra impact damage. 

This deck has done surprisingly well versus current navy because of the sources of extra damage allowing objectives to be taken out fast and missions negating some navy healing tricks.

I had a long debate about replacing one Secret Weapons with one Turning the tide but I feared a fifth mission might clog the deck and even with 4 I find myself dumping missions in edges. Having Tydirium on the board however really messes with dark side and the Stolen AT-ST is just awesome
