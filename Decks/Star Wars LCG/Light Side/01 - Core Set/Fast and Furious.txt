2 Across the Anoat Sector
2 Asteroid Sanctuary
2 Mission Briefing
2 Raise the Stakes
2 Renegade Squadron Mobilization

Hoth-era deck. Requires Core Set, Edge of Darkness, and Hoth Cycle.

Raise the Stakes and Across the Anoat Sector provide the backbone for solo attackers. Renegade Squadron gives support to solo units with Munitions Expert and Echo Caverns. Mission Briefing gives further support with its Heavy Blaster Emplacement- and Battlefield Engineers work wonders with both it and the aforementioned Echo Caverns. Finally, Asteroid Sanctuary rounds out the set- it has the least synergy with the rest of the deck, but the Falcon does allow for some nice hit and run tactics, while the set also has some much needed resource bonuses and the ever annoying Twist of Fate.

Biggest weakness is by far the lack of force icons- expect to lose the Edge. A lot. But all its heavy-hitters have plenty of black icons to work around this fault, not to mention the bonus from Across the Anoat Sector is also a black icon. Don't forget to use those Cloud City Operatives to lock down cheaper enemy units and clear the way for your solo attackers!
