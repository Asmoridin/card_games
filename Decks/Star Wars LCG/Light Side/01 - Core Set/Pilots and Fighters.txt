Almost every set comes with fighters and pilots, so you shouldn't find yourself with unpiloted vehicles.

Yeah, I realized the deck was illegal just after I submitted it. I don't see how I can change it, though. I took out Running the Trench and put in Hoth Operations.

 

I just wanted to try it for the fun in synergy. I'm tired of playing a fighter deck and not able to get a pilot on my fighter because of not having enough pilot and vehicle cards. Having both in every set goes a long way toward fixing that.

 

As far as sacrificing good units for the edge, I'm okay with that. I even sacrificed the Millenium Falcon with Heroic Sacrifice to take out the OP combination of Delta One, Advanced Concussion Missiles and Maarek Stele. I think in this game you have to play what you have and not get too attached to your unique and 5 cost cards.

 

I'm not saying it's the best deck, but it's certainly fun.
