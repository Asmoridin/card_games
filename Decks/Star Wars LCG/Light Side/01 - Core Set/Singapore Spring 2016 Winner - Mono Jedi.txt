Standard Mono-Jedi deck.
Try to get bodies out as fast as possible. Put the pressure on by attacking and exhausting opponent.

Some tips:
If Yoda, You Seek Yoda is drawn in starting hand, play it during opponent's draw step to avoid Rule by Fear.

Always attack with speeder bikes to exhaust first.

If Brainiac is present with no dark side targets, some juicy light side targets include: Luke, to increase the damage dealt with attachments, Force Cleansing to refresh a unit committed to the Force during opponent's turn, or even to simply boost the Speeder Bike's and Wolfman's Edge to 2.
