Experimental
A different version of apotential LOBOT deck. No super gimmicks, just dudes and Force icons.

Smugglers and Spies




2 A Deep Commitment (Darkness and Light 122-1)
2 Heroes and Legends (Heroes and Legends 97-1)
2 In You Must Go
2 The Defense of Cloud City (Edge of Darkness 73-1)
2 The Master's Domain (Between the Shadows 128-1)

This version is different than the other, hence a new list entirely. It is simpler to play, and removes many of the tricks for raw Force. The net is more Yoda, more Force pips, and ways to make those shields really work for you. Coupling the LOBOT set and Ferus' set was something considered originally, but with the interaction now limited to once a turn per copy of Asteroid Base on table, I felt it may be limited in its impact, and I am not excited about the droids. Between the droids and the wing guards, there seem to be many units that are sub-par and the deck already lacks variety of strikers. 
In the end, it is just something different. I chose MD Yoda over MTFBWY Yoda because I wanted the tactics and the chance to get some help from the hut.
