Rebel Alliance




1 Along the Gamor Run
1 Asteroid Sanctuary
2 Haunting the Empire (Power of the Force 252-1)
2 May the Force Be With You
2 Pushing Back the Empire (Allies of Necessity 261-1)
2 Spirit of Rebellion (Allies of Necessity 262-1)


It's literally just all of the top-tier pods smashed together. I've spent more time trying to figure out what affiliation to run than the time it took to figure out the decklist (and I still could use your help figuring that out).

Pros for Rebel: Overall the Smuggler objectives have higher priority anyways so I'd rather play them over the Rebel ones. Also more Rebel cards that I want to play. Teamwork can also have some major power in this deck so having an affiliated resource to play that would be nice. I also have a spot-gloss Rebel card I want to play with. 

Pros for Smuggler: Hard hitting mains in Jyn and Falcon that I always want to be able to play. It would really suck if I couldn't play Deneba as well. Running Smug means I want to see Cassian's objective which means more discount shenanigans (Call to Action -&gt; Free Resource -&gt; T1 Falcon is the idea here).

Yay for a lack of creativity. At least tri-color is pretty cool.
