Casual
The newest incarnation of my Jedi deck.  Had this for a while but wanted to see what people thought.

Jedi




2 A Hero's Beginning (Chain of Command 161-1)
2 A Hero's Trial (Between the Shadows 127-1)
2 May the Force Be With You (Join Us or Die 112-1)
1 Mysteries of the Rim (Imperial Entanglements 176-1)
2 The Survivors
1 Watchers in the Wasteland

I think Rio won a regional using this deck only he swapped out Rim for Crow. I was gonna test it out but never got around to it. Looks solid!
