Jedi




2 A Deep Commitment (Darkness and Light 122-1)
1 Courage of the Tribe (New Alliances 192-1)
2 Sacrifice at Endor (Between the Shadows 131-1)
2 Ties of Blood
1 Tribal Support
2 Warriors of the Forest (Solo's Command 186-1)

// This deck is more or less identical to my Ewok deck except that I use two The Survivors instead of 2 A Deep Commitment. When it works, it works, but going against Sith can be a real uphill fight!
