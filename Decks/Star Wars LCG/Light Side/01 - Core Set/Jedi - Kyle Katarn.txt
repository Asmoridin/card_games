This deck started with a single idea: Heroes and Legends and Kyle Katarn. Include multiple copies of unique Jedi characters in the deck and use Heroes and Legends to be able to refresh them or switch out which version you're playing with as desired.

Of course, there's no guarantee that you'll even draw Heroes and Legends, so the rest of the deck has to be able to stand on its own, and Jedi do a great job at standing on their own, with plenty of Force icons to keep the balance and win edge battles.

It might behoove you to play aggressively, though. I found that even near the beginning of the game, with Heroes and Legends in play and a second copy of Luke Skywalker in my hand, I found more benefit to use Luke in an Edge battle than to use the H&amp;L ability, so you have to know when to veer from your deck building strategy and go with what the situation requires. Even sacrificing an Obi-Wan in an Edge battle, as well, wasn't too disappointing with plenty of Jedi to come back in my hand as I continued to draw cards.
