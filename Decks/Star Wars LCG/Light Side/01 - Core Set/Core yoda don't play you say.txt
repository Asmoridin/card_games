Hello. Its the deck which fits my control style great. Control the table with protection, event-counters and deflection of course. Very possible you will be able to lock the force while harrasing enemy up to the moment of triumph.

True jedi uses force only in defense purposes which is showed in this deck perfectly.

Enjoy and dont forget to share your oppinion!

Ps.
Few combos i like.
In you must go + resource generators(or anything else)
Trial + resource generators
Obi + deflection in your pile
counter stroke, c3p0 + most of sith events : )
Find more by urselves:)
