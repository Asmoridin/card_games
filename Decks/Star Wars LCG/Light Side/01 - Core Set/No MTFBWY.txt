Experimental
Wanted to try to make an enhancement deck with out May the force be with you. I figured 9 of the objectives, but I feel like I am missing something, any ideas. (following fate was the 10th... I guess I will through that in one). I am unsure of whether or not I want a second survivors I like the set, its just some what low edge count.
