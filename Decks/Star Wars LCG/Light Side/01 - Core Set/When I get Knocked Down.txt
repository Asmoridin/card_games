1 Decoy at Dantooine
1 Evacuation Procedure
2 Forward Reconnaissance


This is an updated version of an older deck I tried running.

This deck attempts to maximize on bouncing units back and forth from your hand for devastating combos.

The ideal draw is to get Forward Reconnaissance and then either Decoy At Dantooine (DS tends to attack this first to get its ability out of the way) or Evacuation Procedure (good at freeing up your resource generating enhancements). 

Your starting hand should include at least 1 resource generating enhancement.

If Forward Reconnaissance is in play then try to amass as many cheap units and cards that let you return cards to your hand in order to draw out enemy units and either heavily damage/destroy them or focus them up to make way for a second round of attack free of defenders.
