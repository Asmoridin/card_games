Experimental
A Jedi Mains deck aiming to play a midrange-control game with lots of direct objective and unit damage from Luke, Leia, and Rahn. Leia and Rahn seem to have a natural synergy, since she's a prime removal target. Possibly could use some way to recur Rahn, or allow him to take more damage-perhaps Gotals will make it into a future iteration. 

Jedi are my personal weakest faction, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to test the new Rahn pod.
