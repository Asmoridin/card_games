Flood the board with Ewoks and shields while using a bevy of annoying effects to harass the DS. Cards like Asteroid Base and Native Support can turn even an unassuming Ewok Lookout into an objective-destroying machine. Ferus Olin and the Guardians provide security, while Prep for Battle helps close out games. It might be worth cutting Obi-Wan for a second Prep, but that could make resource matching a bit dicey. Plus, Obi-Wan has great synergy with the Lookouts, and Our Most Desperate Hour was made for Ferus. I don't think this deck is as potent or consistent as Jedi Gamor or Mono Smugglers, but it IS competitive. It's also quite a bit of fun to play, especially when you use an Ewok Companion to machine-gun down Darth Vader.
