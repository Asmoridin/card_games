Sugg: What you want for objectives would be a heros resolve, secret of yavin 4 and defence of yavin 4. Or flight of crow, defence of yavin 4 and a heros resolve. Pretty interesting deck I actually really like it a lot,most of my hand draws were quite decent. uou can put one more objective deck into it I was thinking hit and run or another rebel objective might be nice. Tell me how it played for you people's.
