Han's so difficult to build around. 

This is my best attempt at making the Pathfinders work in a Spark deck. There's 16 Spark units and 4 Endor objectives for Han to work with. Moreover, none of the Endor objectives have "While this objective is undamaged" text so you don't have to worry about turning them off if you attempt to double strike.

There's also a few Leaders to make the Tacticians better. I've realized after playing with double Dodonna that the only good way to make use of his chuds are to Spark them in for free because you never want to pay the cost for them. 

The deck covers all of the basics, but the biggest issue with it is that although it has 6 resource enhancements, 4 of them are tempo killers. I've had quite a few experiences with Rebel character decks in which I could either play a main or a 2/1 resource and it's not a great situation to be in.

I chose Ties of Blood over Strike Team Assemble because that objective and Leia often force your opponent to make really dumb decisions. If you really want to double down on the Leader synergy though, Bren is an option. I just don't like him because he dies too easily and I don't want to turn off his objective in order to double strike.

Yoda's in there because he's Yoda. He could be taken out for Hera though as that pod actually adds Spark/Leader synergy and if you get the 5/2 objective out on the flop you can afford to play a 2/1 without losing tempo.

Enjoy!
