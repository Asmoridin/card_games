// You must control the Force. Nothing special : bring in Yoda as soon as you can, always get MTBWY in your starting objectives if it's available and 
// do not discard "A Jedi's Resolve" ligthly. Ben and Leia should help getting the Force.

// Control the board : Leia, Ben, Luke and Yoda can help you having the way clear. Leia's command should help. Gardians and Ewok should keep you safe.

// Cycle your hand as much as you can and blast Dark Side with Luke, Wolfmen, Red 5 as soon as you have an opportunity. You should support them but not commit
// Leia lightly if she's not available for MTFBWY
