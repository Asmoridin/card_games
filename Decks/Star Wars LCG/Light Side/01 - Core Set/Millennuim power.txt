2 A Hero's Trial (Between the Shadows 127-1)
2 Asteroid Sanctuary (Edge of Darkness 72-1)
2 Heroes and Legends (Heroes and Legends 97-1)
2 May the Force Be With You (Join Us or Die 112-1)
1 Mysteries of the Rim (Imperial Entanglements 176-1)
1 The Secret of Yavin 4

Recommendation: I'd cut Forgotten Masters for a second Heroes and Legends - that's one objective you want two copies of (whereas you probably don't want to ever see Forgotten Masters), and you want more copies of Kyle to loop.
