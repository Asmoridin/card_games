This is basically Shadâ€™s deck from the 11/19 tourney @ the FFG Game Center. Use superior card draw to quickly build board state before crushing multiple objectives.

There are multiple combos in this deck to exploit. Commando Raid goes well with most of the fate cards in the deck. If Hera hits the table, then many of the Wookiees, the Hired hands, the rebel commandos and the specters become quite beastly. Also, with 10 enhancements in the deck, there will be plenty of targets for rebel supply cache or plenty of resources to build board presence.
