Looks very much like the deck that won at gencon.  7 of 10 in fact.  Differences being red 5 instead of survivors and mystic (which wasnt out yet) instead of owen.  I think survivors is definitly better than red 5's pod.  Your missing a way to protect luke and yoda which survivors can help with.  Mystic is a good pod.  I just haven't played it enough to decide the best way to use it.
