Yoda/Luke with Qu Rahn and Mystics in support

Jedi




2 A Hero's Trial (Between the Shadows 127-1)
2 May the Force Be With You
1 Mysteries of the Rim (Imperial Entanglements 176-1)
1 The Flight of the Crow
2 The Secret of Yavin 4
2 The Survivors

The basic idea with this deck is that it's a whole bunch of great cards slapped together. Yoda and Luke are obviously amazing, and Survivors and Secret remain staples as ever to resist enemy control tactics.

Flight of the Crow is a wonderful objective to flop with a magnificent main unit, a wonderful enhancement, a strong event, and two utterly worthless chuds in the middle, making this pod a one-of but never ever a two-of.

And of course the Mystics are hilarious. Niman Training is often going to be near-blank, though; the only targets seem to be Qu Rahn and the Mystics themselves. I guess that's useful too, though.

The strategy should be self-explanatory: the Crow, Luke, Qu Rahn, and/or Yoda swing for the objective kills while everything else keeps them up and running and alive.
