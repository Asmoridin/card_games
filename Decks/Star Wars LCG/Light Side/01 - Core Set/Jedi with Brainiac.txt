A fairly conservative Jedi deck experimenting with Brainiac.

Jedi




2 A Hero's Beginning (Chain of Command 161-1)
2 A Hero's Trial (Between the Shadows 127-1)
1 Matter Under Mind (The Forest Moon 196-1)
2 May the Force Be With You
1 Mysteries of the Rim (Imperial Entanglements 176-1)
2 The Survivors

So before the Endor cycle dropped, this deck was basically everywhere, except it had -1 Matter Under Mind +1 Journey to Dagobah. My thinking is that between Hero's Beginning, Hero's Trial, and the Astromechs you have more than enough numeral shenanigans at your disposal that not having Red Five is going to be okay. You should still be able to lay down enough pressure on the DS with your character mains that you'll be fine, and the Landspeeder will do in a pinch if you need a vehicle attacker.

What do you think? Does Brainiac demand Ties of Blood to capitalize properly, or do you think this will work?
