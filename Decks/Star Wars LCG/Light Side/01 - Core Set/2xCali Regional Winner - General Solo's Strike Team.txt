This deck gets really trixy really fast. It has the ability to have massive first turns. 

Pre-turn one
- Impersonating a deity for an Ewok Scout (lets you sleath past a unit)

- Solidarity of spirit to put out Crix or Han or Homeone

Their Turn

- Rash action their only unit, or at least the bigger of the two. Then use the ewok to stealth past what is left. 

Then on your turn, use Crix to drop lots of stuff! 

Han's commandos just have so much ability to let you block and attack. In my regional I didn't ever flop Solidarity of spirit but has Han with 3 of his commandos on the board on two different games. Hard to stop Han attacking 4 times!
