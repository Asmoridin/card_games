Just playing around with my cardpool and some of the new faction cards.  Figured I'd do a revamp of Hoth speeders.  There's probably a better build for this, but my cardpool is limited so this is what I came up with.

Rebel Alliance


Objective (10)

    2x A Hero's Resolve (Escape from Hoth 64-1)
    1x A Legend Begins (Meditation and Mastery 242-1)
    2x Attack Pattern Delta (The Battle of Hoth 59-1)
    2x Hoth Operations (The Desolation of Hoth 38-1)
    2x Running the Canyon (Technological Terror 256-1)
    1x The Secret at Shantipole (Attack Run 156-1)
