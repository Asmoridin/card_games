Objective (10)

    2x Against All Odds (Lure of the Dark Side 103-1)
    2x Heroes and Legends (Heroes and Legends 97-1)
    1x Last Minute Rescue (Core 6-1)
    2x Matter Under Mind (The Forest Moon 196-1)

This deck attempts to use multiple synergies to create great card flow and eventually build up a large force of Jedi's, or the combo of Brainiac and Dash Rendar to win the game.  Very experimental, but it seems fun in theory.  I have no idea how practical it is.
