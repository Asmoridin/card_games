Affiliation: Sith




1 Agent of the Emperor
2 Counsel of the Sith
2 Fall of the Jedi
2 The Emperor's Web
2 The Executor Arrives
1 The Heart of the Empire


So this is the latest version of my Sith deck.  I haven't touched this for a few months, and I don't know what others are doing with the archetype.  I feel like having the Executor is too much, but I'm not sure.  I put in Heart of the Empire for anti-Jedi, but am thinking of taking it out again.
