2 Counsel of the Sith
2 Fall of the Jedi
2 The Emperor's Web
1 The Imperial Bureaucracy (Chain of Command 163-1)
1 The Last Grand Admiral (Chain of Command 164-1)
2 The Plan of the Prophetess


Overall, this isn't terribly different from the usual Sith Control style, but I prefer the much more aggressive approach to holding control of the Force that comes with Plan of the Prophetess over Mara's approach, while the Bureaucracy is a support pod that I'm convinced should become a 1-of auto-include in Sith decks.
