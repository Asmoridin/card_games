I've been finding that Jedi decks are building board presence before going on the offensive either because it's a shielding deck or low base blast decks.  So the best way to counter that is by trying to get a reset.  To do this we want to work with the tools the dark side has: the scavengers, Zekka Thyne and There is no escape.  

Ghost of the dark side adds dark memories which are great on characters and the objective can help to win the force after a reset. 

Across the Jundland wastes adds a priority target in a character heavy meta and will hopefully get a the scavengers into play.  Tusken raiders are a decent defender too.

Council adds draw, resources and twist of fate.

Findsman's adds force struggle help.
