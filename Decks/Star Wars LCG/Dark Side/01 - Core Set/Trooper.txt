Overwhelm the opponent with too many troopers. Depending on how you draw, this can either be a good deck to hold back and defend or attack, attack, attack!

The main drawback of this deck, that I've seen, is lack of Elites (only one of the officers included is Elite) and lack of resources. However, with overwhelming force you don't necessarily need Elites, and the only card worth more than 4 resources is the star destroyer. Even with only 4 you can usually get out two troopers a turn, or more with card effects.
