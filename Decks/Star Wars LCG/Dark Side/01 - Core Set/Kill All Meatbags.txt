Use Promise of Power for the faction card. Focuses on buffing droids and capturing enemy cards. Sadly has almost no Elite- Droid Uprising helps with this, but Promise of Power is definitely needed to counter any enemy control. Also a bit low on force icons, but with this many black unit damage and tactics icons, that shouldn't be too terrible.
