Affiliation: Imperial Navy




2 Enforced Loyalty

2 Might of the Empire

2 The Tarkin Doctrine (Imperial Entanglements 178-1)

Imperial fortress has been a standard for some time now. Often, it is the deck to beat. With the Death Star resources and refresh, this deck will function at greater speed. With 35 resources, deploy the Death Star for the win. Dead draws can happen, but more often you will find Tarkin for control, Stormtrooper Assault Team for Targeted Strike, Chimera and Thrawn for defense and Yularen and Fist for damage return. There are all good cards in this deck, a great option for tournament play. 

One Option would be substituting Entrenched Defense for Thrawn.
