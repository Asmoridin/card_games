Originally had the Black Squadron set from Core, but took that out for two Defending the Trench.  That's okay by me, as I'm On the Leader and the Pilot from that set were meh.  So yeah, blow things up.

I have played this once, and it's very uncomfortable for me, as I'm used to slower DS decks.  Maybe I'll get over it.
