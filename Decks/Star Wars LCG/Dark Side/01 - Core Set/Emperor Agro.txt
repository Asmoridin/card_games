Set up a turn of Palpatine's mission and super-laser blast. I usually hit 3 objectives each game 2-3 with SLB and 1 the traditional way. Playing the mission turn 1 is great as it makes the LS weary of what they play especially if you bluff having SLB in your hand.

In 5 games I've taken:

-Endor Luke x1
-Balance Obi x1
-Core Leia x1
-Endor Han x1
-Endor Luke x2
-Useless chuds x3

Possible sub outs are something for Sate. I've found this build to be more potent as it seems to hold it's own without needing the combo to go off.
