The 'basic' mono-Navy control deck based around the first 4 objectives from Imperial Entanglements and Thrawn.

Affiliation: Imperial Navy




2 Enforced Loyalty
2 Imperial Entanglements
2 Might of the Empire
2 The Last Grand Admiral (Chain of Command 164-1)
2 The Tarkin Doctrine (Imperial Entanglements 178-1)

The objectives Enforced Loyalty and The Tarkin Doctrine forces the LS into a very difficult situation where damage can quickly accumulate on their objectives unless they can use Rebel Assault, Luke's Speeder or similar to get damage on the objective.

Thrawn, Tarkin, and a Decimator w/Ion Cannon are all very strong control tools to slow down the LS player.
