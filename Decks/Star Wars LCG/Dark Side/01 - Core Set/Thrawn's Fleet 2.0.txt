his deck is designed around Thrawn's ability to dominate the field against Mains. Lots of resources to get out your high-cost units, with plenty of gun chuds to fill out the curve. Thrawn and Emp provide the tactics, while the big boats push damage and R&amp;amp;R/Thunderflare mitigate incoming. Choke and Force Lightning are unexpected in the deck, and there's lots of protect to go around. Probably too heavy on resource enhancements, but this is the early trial version. Key is to edge DSSDs until you have a solid board position/resource base, hopefully with Thrawn out to control engagements.
