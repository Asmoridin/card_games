No tricks or secrets here, this deck wants to vomit resources onto the table and beef up its board state enormously, then swing for the fences.

If I had to name a significant concern I have right now, it's that this deck isn't going to win a whole lot of edge battles in the early game because it will be too busy setting up. It's not that there aren't enough Force icons on the cards; there are plenty. The bigger concern is that the deck is built to PLAY cards, not hold them for the edge; I might have overdone the resources, because it's going to be hard to resist the temptation to play something if it's in my hand and I can pay for it.

Any input to work towards improving this deck would be most welcome.
