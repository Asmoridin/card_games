Affiliation: Sith




2 Agent of the Emperor (Lure of the Dark Side 104-1)
1 Death and Despayre
1 Imperial Blockade
2 Scouring the Empire (Heroes and Legends 100-1)
2 The Dark Trooper Project (Heroes and Legends 101-1)
2 Victory or Death (Lure of the Dark Side 105-1)

The point of this deck is to control the Force. The Dark Trooper Project seems to work immensely well with Victory and Death's Star Destroyers as they have 3 Force Pips a piece. Include Mara and Jerec and you have a lot of un-traditional staying power. It obviously lacks tactic icons, with the only 2 being edge enabled and coming from the Political observers. (Thrawn's set screams for inclusion in this deck, and his tactics would also be much welcomed).
Mara's set could be swapped out for the Emperor's set pretty easily, especially if tactics is what you crave.
This deck can have some pretty explosive strikes, especially once Gen Mohc hits the table. Suddenly those Victory Class Destroyers can have 3 black objective and 2 black unit combat icons. 
The Fate cards are also pretty impressive with 4x Echoes of the Force and 3x Heat.
Suggestions are welcome!
