Xizor, Dengar are your force control units, in my experience, I can kill stuff or keep units focused to control the force to tick the dial up twice. If you tick it up once, explosive turns with Slave 1, Energy Spiders, ponda baba, black sun and dengar with moruth doole. Dr. Evanzan is really good, to block out enhancement lukes ability or even yoda's blasters. Capture event can be comboed with I dont like you either to capture 2 units. Super fun deck!

5-1 with it right now. Don't know really what to change except maybe Lad'ys Lesson, I dont like you either.
