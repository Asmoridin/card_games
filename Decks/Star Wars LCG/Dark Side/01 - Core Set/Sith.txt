Plan of the prophetess : Deadly vision imo is better than Lightning and Servant of the darkside allows me to ping in some damage with almost all my guys (-1 or -2 to force)

Executor : Sith holocron for a free deadly sight or lightning is just sweet. Aggression and the executor for the late game push.

Scouring the empire : Force storm just to deal with vehicle swarm. Jerec isn't that bad but I'm still on the fence about this objective.  In playtesting this proved to better that The ghosts of the darkside objective set. 

It looses to my speeder deck more often than not  and sneaky ships can also be a problem but less than the speeders. Besides that I haven't had many match-ups where It wasn't a fair game.

so I'm still looking for that last vehicle destroying set :-).
