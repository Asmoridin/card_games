You have, count 'em, 35 resources. Yes, 35 resources. This along with admiral's orders, kuat defenses, deploy the fleet and Captain Needa ensures that your Star Destroyers are going to go down for super cheap. I've often double-deployed Star Destroyers in a single turn with this deck. Along with your 35 resources you have 34 (21/13) objective damage. Yes, you should beware sleuths. You do, however have 14 units of 2 cost or lower to help keep them from gaining unopposed damage. And sleuths should beware you. If the light side refuses to defend, they'll never have a chance to win against this deck. With so many low cost, high health units, your own defenses will prove adequate.  I absolutely love playing this deck, and even when I play against it, I can't help but chuckle at its effectiveness. The objectives play very well together. I love damaging "deploy the fleet" to get an ISD down cheaper, than focusing Thunderflare to move that damage to the enemy objective (even when defending!)
