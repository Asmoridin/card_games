1 Behind the Black Sun
2 Heartless Tactics
2 His High Exaltedness
2 Masterful Manipulation
2 Out of the MIsts (Galactic Ambitions 222-1)
1 The Lady's Lesson (Redemption and Return 216-1)

// Masterful Manipulation and Heartless Tactics did the majority of the work today.  Lots of resources.  One game, I cycled a Masterful three times in a row.

// Dengar won a couple games and 4-Lom did a lot of work keeping a 3PO off the board and picking off one or two a game to feed Dengar.

// Nothing really stood out as spectacular.  It was a typical Scum deck...everything did their part without being a standout.  Handled everything thrown at it, but the games were real tight.  Need to figure out how to handle Rebel capitals.
