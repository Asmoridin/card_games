2 All Out Brawl
1 Imperial Command
2 Imperial Entanglements (Imperial Entanglements 181-1)
2 Phantoms of Imdaar (Imperial Entanglements 182-1)
2 The Dark Trooper Project
1 The Last Grand Admiral (Chain of Command 164-1)

AOB and IE are crucial. With the extra damage, Decimators and TIE Phantoms should have an easy time dealing with enemy units thanks to the 6x Heat and Armed to the Teeth. 
If not facing Jedi, you may have a decent chance at winning edge, in which case the troopers can also jump into battle.

You may run into problems if your opponent sits back to flood the board with protectors while holding the Force (realistically, only Jedi should be able to do that, and Qu Rahn is about the only protector they run nowadays).

Wanted to run 2 Thrawn to be even more annoying and make the LS player ragequit, but though the deck needed a bit more consistency with resources, hence 1 Motti. Orbital Bombardment also gives you some closing power.
