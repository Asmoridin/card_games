This deck is ridiculous. It's not great on objective damage in my opinion but its real strength is forcing your opponent to halt his offense while you slowly build a big board. 

Pretty much all of the objectives put big thorns in your opponents side. The ideal flop in my opinion is Dark Lord Emperor's Promise and Stygeon Prime. 

And one of the most satisfying combos I've ever played is the Dark Memories/Hunted. Top it off with Administrative Detainment and you've got a home run. Swiping units with Palpatine's pod is also a great plus.

If you want a bit more offense I consider Mara to be interchangeable with Janus. I run one Counsel because I only have one core set. Might be interesting to experiment with The Killing Cold in its place for Icetromper shenanigans.
