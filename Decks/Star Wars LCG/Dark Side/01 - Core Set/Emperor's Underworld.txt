A fun little deck idea I made when I was creating my list of objective sets and synergies a while ago. 

Building upon the classic Sith Triumvirate of Fall/Counsel/Web to give the essentials, it adds in Zuckuss and IG-88 for more force-based shenanigans. While Zuckuss helps to capture and potentially aid in adding to your force dominance and objective refreshes, IG-88 punishes your opponent, relieving them of their supply and targeting committed units - alongside the Springing the Ambush of Zuckuss.

Happy for feedback, as while it is a casual deck, I'm always happy to hear ways to improve/streamline ideas and themes. I have considered trading 1 Task for 1 Droid Revolution instead, but I'm kinda wanting to keep to a Empire hires Bounty Hunters theme.
