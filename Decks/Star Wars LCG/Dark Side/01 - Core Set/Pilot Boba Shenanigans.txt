Promise of Power Affiliation




2 Black Squadron Formation (Ready for Takeoff 143-1)
2 Masterful Manipulation (Between the Shadows 135-1)
1 Nar Shaddaa Drift (Chain of Command 165-1)
2 The Emperor’s Shadow (Technological Terror 258-1)
1 The Emperor’s Sword (Draw Their Fire 149-1)
2 The Hunter’s Flight (Attack Run 160-1)

Having four 2-resource objectives more or less guarantees you'll have 5 resources T1 so you can either play Xizor or a 2/1 and a 4-drop vehicle. Because of the affiliation, units like the Shuttle or Black Two or Delta One suddenly aren't terrible starters. 

Other than that, the big thing of this deck is recurring Pilot Boba. There's 4 Stay on Targets, 4 Pilot Resources and 8 Pilots to do so. 

The Saboteurs are a pretty obvious counter to Boba but this deck is more on the fun side for me. Hope you enjoy!
