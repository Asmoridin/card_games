Admiral Piett, if you get him out, all but guarantees you'll win the edge when he's attacking, and the opponent will be wary of defending at all. The problem is that Piett himself is hardly useful once the edge battle is over. Capital ships to the rescue, then, to make attacking worth it.
The weakness of capital ships is that they're few and thus easy to lock down. Piett is also easy to lock down since he's not elite (seriously, FFG, what's up with that!?). Grand Admiral Thrawn, however, doesn't like seeing his underlings locked down, and he's here to defend and make sure no locking down takes place (along with bodyguards to make sure he and Piett stay alive and shoot attackers in the face).
