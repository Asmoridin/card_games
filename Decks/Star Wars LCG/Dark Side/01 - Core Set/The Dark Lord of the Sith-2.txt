1 Agent of the Emperor
2 Counsel of the Sith
2 Dark Lord of the Sith (Galactic Ambitions 217-1)
1 Encounter at Stygeon Prime (Galactic Ambitions 218-1)
2 The Emperor's Web
2 The Emperorâ€™s Cabal (A Wretched Hive 238-1)

Use prep and planning to play rage and force lightning. The emperor's cabal can shuffle powerful game changing events such as telekinetic strike, force lightning, rage, and of course the always useful dark precog back into your deck to get multiple uses. However, if you get palp into play make sure to leave 1 or 2 events in your discard pile that you might want to grab with his ability. 

Use Mara jade, Vader, force lightnings, and force chokes to control their board and keep their unit count down. Then, they will have no choice but to bow before the Dark Lord of the Sith. 

All the objectives in this deck are quite powerful. Bury Mara's unless you draw Dark Lord of the Sith. That objective should make it significantly difficult to turn off Mara's objective on the first turn which means it could do some significant work for you as the game progresses. Council speaks for itself and Cabal is also pretty sweet to have in play. Web + prep and planning makes lightning free. Web also makes the torture event a lot more relevant. Always return the event to your hand unless it's going into your turn. With two twists in the deck you can use it to bluff out more cards. 

Win edge battles, kill Jedi, and plunge the galaxy into darkness.
