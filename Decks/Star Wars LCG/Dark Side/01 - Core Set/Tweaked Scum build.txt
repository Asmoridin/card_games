This is working better than the version with Boba Fett that I had earlier. Very heavy on good defensive units and nice capturing tricks.

However, I am finding it difficult to get rid of objectives. It's not as bad as Scum used to be, but I find it tough to close the deal and the game. Any recommendations? Jabba and the Weequays might be axed, but I just don't think it's Scum without Jabba. xD He needs a new version, badly.
