Look to start with 'Jabba's Reach' in play, add the 'Fortified Holding Cells' to his objective, and place some captured cards there. If you can also start with Dengar's objective in play then you can use it to protect 'Jabba's Reach' (provided you have at least 1 captured card there or the holding cells attached). The deck has a ton of edge battle manipulation and tricks and as you increase your reserve value you can leverage this more and more.
