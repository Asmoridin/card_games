Objective (11)

2 Enforced Loyalty
2 Feeding the Pit
2 His High Exaltedness (Scrap Metal 250-1)
1 Pattern Analysis (A Wretched Hive 239-1)
1 The Admiral's Assault
2 The Last Grand Admiral (Chain of Command 164-1)
1 The Spice Trade (New Alliances 195-1)

Weird to say that's an aggro/control deck but you can do both, with some great defenders (Thrawn, Jabba, Mithel, krayt) combined with a potential of awesome offensive obj-destroyer double strikers (Krayt/Spider +Spice Vision/Blitz, Kallus/Yularen-Disruptor/Thrawn-Disruptor with Spice Vision/Spice Blitz/Chain of COmmand) and recursive Spice Blitz/Vision with His High Exaltedness.

Some tricks with self-inflicted damage from Sarlaac and Yularen/Fist.

Con : really dependant of objective flop and objective ressources, because there's only 2 Control Room and 2 Bib in the deck. You always keep Tatoinne obj for Sarlaac ressources shenanigans, and also Spice Trade for Elite ressources, so sometimes you end up with only 1 navy ressource.
