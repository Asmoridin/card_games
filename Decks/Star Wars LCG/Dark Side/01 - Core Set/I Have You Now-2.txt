The deck is pretty straightforward: hit hard, hit fast, hit often, with lots and lots of cheap Fighters. With blast icons on 26 out of the 28 units in this deck -- and the means to put blast icons on the two copies of Black Two, if needed -- as well as the hilarious economy boost from Guarding Their Wing, this deck creates a full court press scenario, smothering the light side in threats to their objectives and forcing them onto the defensive. The mass of fighters can also be used to bring down incoming threats by covering them in more unit damage from more sources than they have the ability to deal with. DS-61-3 and the TIE Attack Squadrons provide the means to cut anything down to size if it's shy about getting in the fight or big enough push through the other units.

This deck's defensive strategy is to force the light side attackers to fly through a hurricane of fighters that will drown them in unit damage. Once you've stabilized and can tank the light side's offensive, it's time for you to turn around and murder them. With Fel and the 181st Interceptors, the Force struggle should be within your grasp soon enough, and Vader just shuts things DOWN.
