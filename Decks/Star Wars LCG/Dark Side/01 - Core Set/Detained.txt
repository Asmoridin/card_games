This deck is mainly about using capture and force struggle to the max. Slave trade objective can capture freely while balance is with dark side, Fiendman's intuition add to force struggle and Jerec can also help with that by bumping units out of the force. If Ysanne shows up she can prevent captured units for being played. 
Second version of the concept. Got Jerec out as the set is so-so. I added a second copy of Emperor and Mara Jade instead. Also I changed Bobba Fett for Tatooine Crash site.  It's not my all-time favorite pod overall but the objective is quite deadly and 6 health.
