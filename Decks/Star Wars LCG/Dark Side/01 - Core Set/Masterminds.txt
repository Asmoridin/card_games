I play this deck in very control manner. For some time I played with Boba/sth else instead of Xizor  and played it in more aggresive way but Xizor fits my playstyle more.

R&amp;R was included to enhance resource curve when I wasn't using xizor. While I included him in I wasn't so sure if R*R gonna be good choice but with control style of the deck i find it pretty good choice. All I d wonder about would be second yularen.

However, can't wait for new Palpy, it gonna work great, but dunno in what way i'm gonna go with him, guri with zeka/maybe xizor or Thrawn. : (
