This deck runs itself. Enforced Loyalty to smash the enemies objectives. Always get some resources on turn one. Use Endor entrapment to stop damage in key points as often as you can. 

I found that I didn't need to be too aggressive until there was lots of damage on the objectives. Tarkin dealt with any really hard problems. 

This deck won the Southern Cali Regional without losing and I won it in the Northern Californa regionals also undefeated. 

Personally, I think Tarkin is too good. But so it goes!
