// Anyway, deck's pretty straightforward: get out big mean capital ships and smash some faces. 
// Tarkin and Yularen are the only pods that don't give you ships, but since Yularen rains damage on enemy objectives and 
// Tarkin gives you magnificent defensive power (and offensive power thanks to Targeted Strike on that assault team), they complement the ships very nicely.

// Play defensively to start, but once you have a powerful board position, rain devastation on the light side. It should be no trouble for you.
