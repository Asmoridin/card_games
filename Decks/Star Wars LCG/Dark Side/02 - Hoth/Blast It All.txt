// You have plenty of cheap units to put out for defense. You'll be ready for the killing blow in three turns. 
// The "Dark Time for the Rebellion" objectives go well with the 4 imperial probe droids, easily putting damage onto objectives which 
// activate Colonel Stark and the MTV-7s. 

// The main attraction of this deck is all the various ways to surprise your opponent with bursts of blast power. 
// The light side sees no threats, leaves inadequate defenders, and pays for it. 

// Darth Vader is a walking Orbital Bombardment (which you also have). Four ways to give all your attacking units a 
// black blast damage is impressive. Add in the heavy fires, talon rolls, and death from above, and you've got even more surprise fire power. 
// The moorsh moraine can also be a nasty surprise. 

// Clearly the lightside will defend and stop some of your units and some of your tactics, yet this deck that boasts 116 blast damage,
// will find a way through. Timing, as always, is everything. Defend for a couple of rounds and then let loose. It won't take long to get the dial spinning.
