// Destroys LS Objectives without attacking

// The old Tarkin is all but forgotten. "He's too weak. You can't keep him on the board." But if enforced loyalty, a dark time for the rebellion, 
// Yularen, Imperial Fist, Aggressive Assault and Thunderflare have done a bit of work... Tarkin destroys three objectives just by being deployed. 
// Need more? Throw down a superlaser and finish off the stunned LS player's deck.

// Maybe your card draws don't let you play a control style game. That's alright, you've got a lot of units which can blow up objectives pretty fast. 
// (Consider replacing Thrawn with Forward Command Post). Moorsh Moraine and Heavy Fire make a brutal combo.
