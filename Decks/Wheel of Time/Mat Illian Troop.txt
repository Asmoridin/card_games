Two things stand out here. Lucky Find without another faux opening hand card it goes and gets, so I assume it names Player Advantage where could be one of two possibilities.

Are the Plots in this deck actually Plots? I’m not sure. If so, well, that’s cool. I can’t see a combo to enable them to recruit. Maybe they are to play Connections, if that’s even legal, except that’s two cards to draw two cards other than the minor support/opposition gain.
