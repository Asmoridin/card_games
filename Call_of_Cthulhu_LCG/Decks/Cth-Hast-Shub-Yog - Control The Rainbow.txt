Non-characters control deck. Not easy to play, but I have a great pleasure from playing it every time.
This is the deck that I use to won another polish tournament. The strategy is "simple" - don't allow the opponent to win the stories and discard him. As you can see, the deck is only 47 cards, because the missing three is Glimpse of the Void, which at this point is banned in deckbuilder and cannot be added to the decklist. 

What do you think guys? I know there are plenty of cards matching this idea, but I decided to use those. Any thoughts or suggestions?
