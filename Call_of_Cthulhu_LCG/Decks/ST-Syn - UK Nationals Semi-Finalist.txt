Naomi lets me use Immurement and On the Lam multiple times, and Irish Channel lets me re-draw them to use again. Characters are cheap and numerous to apply pressure. 

Slight Disclaimer - Posting this deck from memory, it may be slightly inaccurate on card numbers. Card names are definitely correct though.

Changes I would make after Nationals

 - Drop Hanyatl's. I don't have enough skill manipulation to be able to reliably draw this, often when I do I then don't have a suitable card to put into play. 

- Drop You Know Too Much. undoubtedly a great card but the deck doesn't take too much advantage of it. 

- Drop Jonny V's Dame. Even when I got her early doors I often resourced her. 

- Add Lodge Barkeeps to replace the Dame (and keep enough ST in the deck).
