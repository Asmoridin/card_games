    The evolution of http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/callofcthulhu/call-of-cthulhu-decks/_/call-of-cthulhu-decks/the-libraries-of-yog-sothoth-r96.

The deck is built around wanting to abuse the libraries and the struggles they manipulate.
Daring Buju and Alternative Historian removes Terror and Combat for me, whilst Alexandria and Ebla add additional Arcane and Investigation to keep more characters standing and take stories faster, which also increases the reward from Excavation Site to fuel the Historian.

All of the MU characters can be reduced by Overworked Graduate Student, further keeping the cost low, and as he doesn't state to a minimum of 1, means I could get out more than 3 cards per turn. If he has a tome, and there is at least 1 tome I wish to trigger (Book of Black Stones is ideal), along with the Great Library of Celaeno, it means I can use him more than once in a turn.

Along with aggressive drawing, Whitton Greene helps me search for tomes, whilst Kelly McIlhenney can sacrifice her life for whichever character I really need.
