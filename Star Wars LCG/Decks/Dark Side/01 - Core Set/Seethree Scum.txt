This is a big change from its last incarnation; I've swapped in six new sets and still don't have a feel for the deck.  It feels very rough so far, and I'm sure it will change more when Jabba hits stores this week.  Help would be appreciated, though Bounty Hunters are probably going to wind up being the main focus a la Jabba.
