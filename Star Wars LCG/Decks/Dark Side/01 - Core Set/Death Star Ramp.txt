// So this is the not as fun version of the turn 2 death star deck that in that it is actually good. Main thing you want to do with this deck is abuse the 3 elite resources you have to pump out a rather insane tempo advantage. All of the objectives are pretty good and getting a Death Star turn 2 is a possibility. Although the more likely scenario is turn 3 or 4. But the Death Star is still a playable unit in this deck. 

// There's a lot of non-limited money in this deck, be prepared to spam hard and double tap your objectives. Just be mindful of when you're in Death Star range to actually get it on the table when given the chance.

// Thunderflare or Motti can easily go in the Golan slot.
