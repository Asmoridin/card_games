First/second turn - Set up defenses with Energy Spiders and smaller units. Try to get resources out early as well. 

IG-88 with All-Out Brawl and Illegal Modifications is a BEAST in his own right. (doubly-so with Hidden Vibroknife)

IG's ability also triggers off Guri and the Reprogrammed DRK-1. Attack with IG and Freelance Assassin to take out the units committed to the Force and finish off with the Reprogrammed droids.

Keep creatures for defense (unless going to close the game). Bubo also helps with IG's illegal mods.

If Light Side guys are too "fat" for IG to take out by himself, send him in with other guys with guns (Rancor/Assassin Droid is a good choice). Use his targeted strike to pull them in and let his buddy finish them off.
