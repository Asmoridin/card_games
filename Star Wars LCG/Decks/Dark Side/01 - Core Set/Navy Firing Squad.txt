// As the name implies, this is all about guns. Lots and lots of black guns that murder any attacking units. 
// The goal is to build up as many troopers as you can and stall for Orbitals, then blow everything up really fast. 
// Veers is there to provide troopers with that much needed 3rd gun to kill mains, and AT-ST's are good for some cheap bombs.
// Death Star is there for ramp and edge.
