Probably a little too much going on. I like tactics, some capture, and bouncing units in and out for cool abilities, but I'm not sure this adds up. I am wondering if I should take new Boba out in particular and put Feeding the Pit and/or Lucrative Contract back in. This is full of problems, for sure.
