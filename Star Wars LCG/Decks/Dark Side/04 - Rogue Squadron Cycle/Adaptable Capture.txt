// For objectives Spice trade, Masterful Manipulation, Heartless Tactics and Tatooine Crash are priorities. 

// Xizor, Dengar are your force control units, in my experience, I can kill stuff or keep units focused to control the force to tick the dial up twice.
// If you tick it up once, explosive turns with Slave 1, Energy Spiders, ponda baba, black sun and dengar with moruth doole.
// Dr. Evanzan is really good, to block out enhancement lukes ability or even yoda's blasters. Capture event can be comboed with I dont like you either to capture 2 units.
