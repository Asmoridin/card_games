Either Luke serves as a main as well Rahn.  Place as many Enhancements on them as possible, especially Hidden in the shadows to keep safe from Enemy events. Try to have Hidden from the Empire as an objective to help control the deployment of enemy units.  Sneak Yoda in with "you seek Yoda" and Vim in through her effect.
