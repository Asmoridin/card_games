Becomes a lot more consistent with Galactic Ambitions. It's still nowhere near T1 due to its vulnerability, but a fun deck to play nontheless.

Rebel Alliance




2 Against All Odds
2 Capital Cover (Galactic Ambitions 228-1)
2 Command and Control (Evasive Maneuvers 152-1)
2 Solidarity of Spirit (The Forest Moon 197-1)
2 The Defense of Yavin 4

HATC gives you more cards to use with DOY4. It also makes it more likely you get that turn 1 Independence along with increasing the likelihood that you get Concentrated Firepower when you need it.

 

Home 1/Independence/Defiance is just a good capital ship core that can wreck havoc when the pieces hit right.

Apart from what kiramode mentioned, the deck is build to exploit Home1, which can come out strong depending on your starting hand. The dream setup is 8-103-197.

 

The other key card imo is Depot. Depending on the matchup and the setup, the deck can be played very offensively or very passively, the latter consisting in you building up your board for an alpha strike.
