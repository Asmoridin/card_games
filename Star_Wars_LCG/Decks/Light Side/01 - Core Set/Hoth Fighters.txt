Thinking of putting in a Hold the Line, or take out Echo base defense...

Affiliation: Rebel Alliance


Objective (11)

2 Attack Pattern Delta
2 Called to Arms (Draw Their Fire 147-1)
1 Echo Base Defense
2 Hoth Operations
2 Rogue Squadron Assault (Ready for Takeoff 141-1)
2 The Hoth Gambit


The hope is to get 2 Hoth Gambit and 1 Called to arms as part of your first Objective pull, making you have 2 Force Icons commited to your side of the force, Thus FORCING the opponent to commit one of his bigger units to take it. Keep the hoth Objectives up and dish out pain using Speeders and Fighters. Most DS decks seem to not use Hoth Objectives so the "if you control more" ideas can be really helpful here.
