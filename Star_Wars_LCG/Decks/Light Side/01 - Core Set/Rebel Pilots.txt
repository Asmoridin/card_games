Rebel Alliance





2 Called to Arms (Draw Their Fire 147-1)
2 Heroes of the Rebellion (Jump to Lightspeed 167-1)
2 Hoth Operations
2 Rogue Squadron Assault (Ready for Takeoff 141-1)
2 Running the Trench (Attack Run 157-1)

Reasoning to exclude Defense of Yavin 4?

I'd personally drop one Running the Trench and one Heroes of the Rebellion for 2 Defense. Moar Rebel Assaults.
