2 Attack Pattern Delta
2 Commando Operations
1 Commando Raid
1 Hit and Run
2 Hoth Operations
2 The Defense of Yavin 4

Taking a speeder deck and stapling on the commando/fate card core. Yavin 4 for extra APD hits. Battle of Hoth shenanigans with the commando stuff. Needs more Hoth maybe?

Needed something to beat face with, given the core of H&amp;R, Crix, and Page. Speeders beat moderate face, as I recall.
