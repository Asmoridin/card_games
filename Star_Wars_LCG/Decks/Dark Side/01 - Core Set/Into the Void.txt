Affiliation: Sith


Objective (12)

2 Cell Block Detention
2 Cruel Interrogations
2 Maw of Madness (Press the Attack 209-1)
2 Sector Lockdown
2 Take Them Prisoner
2 The Questioning (Evasive Maneuvers 153-1)

Stay alive long enough to cause them to loose by running out of cards. 
Only 2 of your units have abilities that trigger from attacking, so focus on defending to prevent any unopposed bonus damage.
Between all of the discard, capture, and battle icon spreads on your units you should be able to prevent the light side from killing your objectives, while you burn their command deck away.
