2 Deploy the Fleet
2 Fall of the Jedi
2 The Emperor's Web
2 The Emperor's Sword (Draw Their Fire 149-1)
2 The Executor Arrives


 I found deploy the fleet to be quite useful to kill objectives (With Maarek it one-shot kill any exausted objective in play) and admiral's order can also be used to help to bring executor in play. As usual emperor and Vader pod help to control the board and dish out some damage and unit destruction. I found some weakness vs sleuth as it focuses on big units. I may dish out 1 deploy the fleet but I have not finished all the test I want. Feel free to comment !
