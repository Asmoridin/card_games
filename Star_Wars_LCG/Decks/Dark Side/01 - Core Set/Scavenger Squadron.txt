Nothing in this deck costs more than 3. That's good because you'll only have 11 resources total. Not to worry with Kuat Reinforcements, those vehicles will go down cheap! Worried about Jedi units attacking? Jundland wastes and Sandcrawlers will shut them down. Your scavengers will jump in and out of play with tactics for days. Your fighters will double strike all day with 4 talon rolls. Low on force pips? Don't worry, you've got 4 twists and a couple of gaffi sticks. Talk about a surprisingly effective deck coming out of left field. Sleuths will have a hard time finding open space on your board. With so many cheap units, you'll build an impenetrable wall in no time. Virtues of this deck include loads of unit damage 20/12 and ample blast damage 8/10. 12 (tactics) will frustrate your opponent's advances to be sure.
