2 Kuat Reinforcements
2 Superior Numbers

As simple as it could be : deploy ties and special unit, swarm your opponent and destroy its objectives every turn. If needed, some tricks with Tallon Roll, Heavy Fire, Death From Above and Black Squadron Assault !

A big weakness spotted : except for some Stromtrooper, there is no defense-able unit in the deck. 

Imperial Navy affi is mandatory, because of Superior Numbers and Vader's Tie Advanced can be a dead card if none of the two sith objectives or the two escort carriers are not present.

Any comments and advise should be welcomed warmly. Deck is not designed to be Tier 1 but fun to play and competitive to win several games !
