// Having four 2-resource objectives more or less guarantees you'll have 5 resources T1 so you can either play Xizor or a 2/1 and a 4-drop vehicle. Because of the affiliation, units like the Shuttle or Black Two or Delta One suddenly aren't terrible starters. 

// Other than that, the big thing of this deck is recurring Pilot Boba. There's 4 Stay on Targets, 4 Pilot Resources and 8 Pilots to do so.
