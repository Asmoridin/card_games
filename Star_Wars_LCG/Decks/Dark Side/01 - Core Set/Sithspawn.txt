Ok, so lets cut to the chase on this one. I built this deck for fun and to give Sithspawn a try. I just thought it might be a fun casual deck. Oh boy was I wrong. This deck has been mopping the floor. As it turns out, hunters of the jedi is an absolutely amazing objective. Like seriously block a yoda attack with your servant of the dark side. Hey, thanks for the free tarentek man! And oh man are tarenteks awesome blockers. Between Brothers of the Sith and the dark lair the card draw in this deck can get absolutely out of control! 

Another thing I want to quickly address is how freaking powerful deluxe palps objective is. That royal guard champion makes is why in and out of the discard like you wouldn't believe. And the best part is when they kill him you can get a free unit with hunters of the jedi, because yeah thats right. He's force sensitive baby! 

Another awesome play is this. Wait for them to attack with a big main. Then telekinetic strike them with one unit and then block with your tarentek and kill them. Tukata's rain the tactics down too.

Plan of the prophetess and power of the dark side is another great objective combo and saris herself works well with force manipulation. 

Lastly, I cannot stress enough how good hunters of the jedi is. The other day I mulliganed into a hand with no resources and a sith worm. I discard and drew like an echoes of the force or something. My first turn was a worm. No resource, just a worm. And I managed to win that game. That is how much I love this deck. To come back from a start like that is almost unfathomable. But hunters of the jedi allowed to deploy a free tarentek when they killed my servant of the dark side the next turn. That was when the tide started to turn.
